**EXAMPLE PARAGRAPHS FROM TARGET STYLE (for rhythm and structure reference only):**
{examples}

**MARKOV TEMPLATE - SENTENCE LENGTH PATTERN TO FOLLOW:**
{markov_template}

**INPUT PARAGRAPH TO RESTRUCTURE:**
{input_content}

**TASK:** Restructure the input paragraph to vary sentence lengths as specified in the Markov template above. Your ONLY job is to change sentence boundaries and punctuation - NOT to change words.

**CRITICAL: PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL VOICE**
- This is a personal narrative. Keep it personal.
- Do NOT inject academic vocabulary, philosophical terms, or formal language.
- The author's voice and word choices are deliberate - preserve them exactly.
- If the input says "ghost" keep "ghost", not "specter" or "apparition"
- If the input says "ruins" keep "ruins", not "remnants" or "detritus"

**WHAT YOU MUST DO:**
1. VARY SENTENCE LENGTHS: Mix short (5-10 words), medium (15-25 words), and long (30+ words) sentences
2. VARY SENTENCE STARTERS: Don't start multiple sentences with the same word
3. USE ONLY THE ORIGINAL WORDS: 95%+ of input words must appear unchanged
4. PRESERVE ALL: Citations [^N], proper nouns, numbers, technical terms

**WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO:**
- DO NOT add new vocabulary or academic terms
- DO NOT paraphrase or use synonyms
- DO NOT change word forms ("defines" cannot become "defining")
- DO NOT use em-dashes (—) or double hyphens (--)
- DO NOT add philosophical jargon (process, development, contradiction, principal, aspect, concrete, revolutionary)
- DO NOT output any analysis, headers, or explanations

**HOW TO RESTRUCTURE:**
- Combine short sentences: "The sky was dark. Rain fell." → "The sky was dark; rain fell."
- Split long sentences: Use periods or semicolons to create natural breaks
- Reorder clauses: Move phrases to different positions within the sentence

**OUTPUT:** The restructured paragraph only. No commentary.
