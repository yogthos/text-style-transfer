IGNORE these (they are NOT errors):
- Changes in vocabulary (e.g., "big" → "cyclopean")
- Changes in tone or atmosphere
- Added adjectives, adverbs, or descriptive phrases
- Sentence restructuring or combining

ONLY fix these:
- Missing specific names, dates, or numbers
- Contradicted core events or facts
- Removed key entities that change meaning

Preserve the writing style exactly. Output ONLY the corrected text.
