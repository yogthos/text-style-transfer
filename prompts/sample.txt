On Contradiction


The law of contradiction in things, that is, the law of the
unity of opposites, is the most basic law in materialist dialectics.
Lenin said: “In its proper meaning, dialectics is the study of the
contradiction within the very essence of things." 1 Lenin often
called this law the essence of dialectics; he also called it the kernel
of dialectics. 2 Therefore, in studying this law, we cannot but
touch upon a wide range of subjects, upon a great number of
problems of philosophy. If we can clear up all these problems,
we shall arrive at a basic understanding of materialist dialectics.
These problems are: the two world outlooks; the universality
of contradiction; the particularity of contradiction; the principal
contradiction and the principal aspect of a contradiction; the
identity and the struggle of the aspects of a contradiction; the
role of antagonism in contradiction.

In recent years, philosophical circles in the Soviet Union have
subjected the idealism of the Deborin school to criticism. This has
aroused great interest among us. Deborin’s idealism has exerted
a very bad influence in the Chinese Communist Party, and it
cannot be said that dogmatic ways of thought in our Party have
nothing to do with the style of work of this school. Thus our
present study of philosophy should have as its principal objec¬
tive the eradication of dogmatic ways of thought.


The Two World


Outlooks


In the history of human knowledge, there have always been
two views on the laws of development of the world: The meta¬
physical view and the dialectical view, which form two mutually
opposed world outlooks. Lenin said: “The two basic (or two pos¬
sible? or two historically observable?) conceptions of develop¬
ment (evolution) are: development as decrease and increase,
as repetition, and development as a unity of opposites (the
division of the one into mutually exclusive opposites and their
reciprocal relation).” 3 Lenin was referring to these two different
world outlooks.

For a very long period of history, in China as well as in
Europe, metaphysics formed part of the idealist world outlook
and occupied a dominant position in human thought. In the early
days of the bourgeoisie in Europe, materialism was also meta¬
physical. The Marxist materialist-dialectical world outlook
emerged because the social economy of many European coun¬
tries had entered the stage of highly-developed capitalism; be¬
cause the productive forces, the class struggle, and the sciences
all developed to a level unprecedented in history; and because
the industrial proletariat had become the greatest motive force
in historical development. Then, besides an openly avowed, ex¬
tremely barefaced, reactionary idealism, vulgar evolutionism also
emerged from the bourgeoisie to oppose materialist dialectics.

The so-called metaphysical world outlook or the world out¬
look of vulgar evolutionism means looking at the world from
an isolated, static, and one-sided point of view. It regards all
things in the world, their forms and their species, as forever
isolated from one another and forever changeless. If any change
is admitted, it is merely an increase or decrease in quantity or a transfer in space. Moreover, the cause of such an increase or
decrease or transfer does not lie inside things, but outside them,
that is, through propulsion by external forces. Metaphysicians
hold that all varieties of things in the world, as well as their
characteristics, have remained the same since the moment they
came into being. Any subsequent change is a mere quantitative
expansion or contraction. They hold that a thing can only be
repeatedly reproduced as the self-same thing forever and cannot
change into something of a different kind. In their eyes, capitalist
exploitation, capitalist competition, the ideology of individualism
in capitalist society, and so on, can all be found in the slave
society of antiquity, or even in primitive society, and will con¬
tinue to exist forever without any change.

As to the causes of social development, they find the explana¬
tion in conditions external to society like geography and climate.
They naively seek outside the things themselves for the cause
of their development, and repudiate the theory advanced by
materialist dialectics that it is the contradictions inside things
that cause their development. Therefore, they cannot explain
the multiplicity of the quantities of things; nor can they explain
the phenomenon of one quality changing into another. In Europe,
this mode of thought existed as mechanistic materialism in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and as vulgar evolutionism
at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
centuries. In China, the metaphysical mode of thought that
“Heaven changes not, and the Way too changes not,” 4 was for a
long time supported by the decadent feudal ruling classes.
Imported from Europe in the last hundred years, mechanistic
materialism and vulgar evolutionism have been supported by
the bourgeoisie.

Contrary to the metaphysical world outlook, the materialist-
dialectical world outlook advocates the study of the develop¬
ment of things from the inside, from the relationship of a thing
to other things. The development of things should be regarded
as their internal and necessary self-movement, a thing in its
movement and the things around it should be regarded as inter¬
connected and interacting upon each other. The basic cause of the development of things does not lie outside but inside them,
in their internal contradictions. The movement and development
of things arise because of the presence of such contradictions in¬
side all things. This contradiction within a thing is the basic cause
of its development, while the interconnection of a thing with, and
its interaction upon, other things are the secondary causes of its
development. Thus materialist dialectics forcefully combats the
theory of external causes of propulsion advanced by metaphysi¬
cal mechanistic materialism and vulgar evolutionism. It is evident
that purely external causes can only lead to the mechanical mo¬
tion of things, that is, to changes in size and quantity, but cannot
explain why things are qualitatively different in a thousand and
one ways and why things change into one another. As a matter
of fact, even a mechanical motion of things propelled by some
external force is also brought about through their internal con¬
tradictions. Mere growth in plants and animals and their quanti¬
tative development are also chiefly caused by their internal
contradictions.

Similarly, social development is chiefly due not to external,
but to internal causes. Many countries exist under almost the
same geographical and climatic conditions, yet the difference
and unevenness in their development are extremely great. Tre¬
mendous social changes take place even in one and the same
country, while its geography and climate have not changed.
Imperialist Russia changed into the Socialist Soviet Union, and
feudal, insulated Japan changed into imperialist Japan, although
the geography and climate of these two countries have not
changed. China, for long dominated by feudalism, has under¬
gone great changes in the last hundred years and is now chang¬
ing in the direction of a new China, liberated and free; yet her
geography and climate have not changed. The geography and
climate of the earth as a whole and of every part of it are also
changing, but these changes obviously appear very small when
compared with changes in society. In the former the changes
manifest themselves in terms of tens of thousands or millions
of years, while in the latter they manifest themselves in mere
thousands, hundreds, tens, or even a few years or even months (as in times of revolution). According to the viewpoint of ma¬
terialist dialectics, changes in nature are chiefly due to the
development of the internal contradictions in nature. Social
changes are chiefly due to the internal contradictions in society,
namely, the contradiction between the productive forces and the
relations of production, the contradiction between the classes,
and the contradiction between the old and the new. It is the
development of these contradictions that impels society forward
and starts the process of the superseding of the old society by
a new one.

Does materialist dialectics leave external causes out of ac¬
count? Not at all. Materialist dialectics considers external causes
as the condition of change and internal causes as the basis of
change, external causes becoming operative through internal
causes. In a suitable temperature an egg changes into a
chicken, but no temperature can change a stone into a chicken
because the fundamentals of the two things are different. There
is a constant, interacting influence between the peoples of
different countries. In the era of capitalism, especially in the
era of imperialism and the proletarian revolution, interacting
influences and stimulation — political, economic and cultural—
between various countries have been extremely great.

The Socialist October Revolution ushered in a new epoch
not only in Russian history but also in world history, exerting
an influence on the internal changes in all countries of the world
and, in a similar and yet particularly profound way, on the
internal changes in China. Such changes, however, arose accord¬
ing to an inner necessity in those countries as well as in China.
Two armies engage in battle; one is victorious and the other is
defeated: Both victory and defeat are determined by internal
causes. One is victorious either because of its strength or because
of its correct command; the other is defeated either because of its
weakness or because of its incompetent command: It is through
internal causes that external causes become operative. In 1927
the Chinese big bourgeoisie defeated the proletariat, operating
through the opportunism existing within the Chinese proletariat
itself (within the Chinese Communist Party). When we Iiquidated this opportunism, the Chinese revolution resumed its
advance. Later, the Chinese revolution again suffered severe blows
from the enemy, because adventurism appeared within our party.
When we liquidated this adventurism, our cause once more
resumed its advance. Thus, if a political party is to lead the
revolution to victory, it must rely upon the correctness of its
own political line and the consolidation of its own organization.

The dialectical world outlook had already emerged in ancient
times in both China and Europe. But ancient dialectics has some¬
thing spontaneous and naive about it. Being based upon the social
and historical conditions of those times, it could not fully explain
the world, and was later supplanted by metaphysics. The famous
German philosopher Hegel, who lived from the latter part of the
eighteenth century to the early part of the nineteenth, made very
important contributions to dialectics, but his is idealist dialectics.
It was not until the great men of action of the proletarian move¬
ment, Marx and Engels, made a synthesis of the positive achieve¬
ments in the history of human knowledge and, in particular,
critically absorbed the rational elements of Hegelian dialectics,
and created the great theory of dialectical materialism and his¬
torical materialism, that a great, unprecedented revolution took
place in the history of human knowledge. Subsequently, this
great theory has been further developed by Lenin and Stalin.
As soon as it was introduced into China, this theory brought
about tremendous changes in the sphere of Chinese thought.

This dialectical world outlook chiefly teaches man how to be
good at observing and analyzing the movement in opposites of
various things and, on the basis of such analyses, to point out the
methods of resolving the contradictions. Consequently, it is of
paramount importance for us to understand concretely the law
of contradiction in things.

II. The Universality of
Contradiction


For convenience in exposition, I shall deal here first with
the universality of contradiction, and then with the particularity
of contradiction. Because the great creators and continuers of
Marxism—Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin—established the ma¬
terialist-dialectical world outlook, applied materialist dialectics
with very great success to many aspects of the analysis of human
history and natural history, to many aspects of changes in society
and nature (as in the Soviet Union), and because the universality
of contradiction is admitted by a great number of people, only
a few words need be said to clarify this problem. But there are
still many comrades, especially the dogmatists, who are not clear
about the problem of the particularity of contradiction. They do
not understand that the universality of contradiction resides
precisely in the particularity of contradiction. Nor do they under¬
stand the great significance which the study of the particularity
of contradiction in the concrete things confronting us has for our
guidance in the development of revolutionary practice. Therefore,
the problem of the particularity of contradiction should be studied
with special attention and explained at sufficient length. For this
reason, when we analyze the law of contradiction in things, we
should first analyze the problem of the universality of contradic¬
tion, then analyze with special attention the problem of the par¬
ticularity of contradiction, and finally return to the problem of
the universality of contradiction.

The problem of the universality or absoluteness of contra¬
diction has a twofold meaning. One is that contradiction exists
in the process of development of all things; the other is that in
the process of development of each thing a movement in opposites
exists from beginning to end.

Engels said: “Motion itself is a contradiction.” 6 Lenin defines
the law of the unity of opposites as “the recognition (discovery)
of the contradictory, mutually exclusive, opposite tendencies in
all phenomena and processes of nature (including mind and
society).” 6 Are these views correct? Yes, they are. The mutual
dependence and mutual struggle of the aspects of contradiction
contained in all things determine the life of all things and impel
their development. There is nothing that does not contain con¬
tradiction; without contradiction there would be no world.

Contradiction is the basis of simple forms of motion ( e.g
mechanical motion) and still more the basis of complex forms of
motion.

Engels explained the universality of contradiction in these
terms: “If simple mechanical change of place contains a contra¬
diction, this is even more true of the higher forms of motion of
matter, and especially of organic life and its development. . . .
Life consists just precisely in this—that a living thing is at each
moment itself and yet something else. Life is therefore also a
contradiction which is present in things and processes them¬
selves, and which constantly asserts and solves itself; and as soon
as the contradiction ceases, life too comes to an end, and death
steps in. We likewise saw that also in the sphere of thought we
could not avoid contradiction, and that, for example, the con¬
tradiction between man’s inherently unlimited faculty of knowl¬
edge and its actual realization in men who are limited by their
external conditions and limited also in their intellectual faculties
finds its solution in what is, for us at least, and from a practical
standpoint, an endless succession of generations, in infinite
progress. . . .

“One of the basic principles of higher mathematics is the
contradiction. . . . But even lower mathematics teems with con¬
tradictions.”

Lenin likewise explained the universality of contradiction as
follows:

“In mathematics: - and — ; differential and integral.

“In mechanics: action and reaction.

“In physics: positive and negative electricity.

“In chemistry: the combination and dissociation of atoms.

“In social science: the class struggle.”

In war, offense and defense, advance and retreat, victory and
defeat are all contradictory phenomena. Without the one, the
other cannot exist. These two aspects struggle and also unite
with each other, constituting the totality of the war, impelling
the war’s development, and solving the war’s problems.

Every difference in man’s concepts should be regarded as the
reflection of objective contradictions. Objective contradictions are
reflected in subjective thought, constituting the movement in
opposites of concepts, impelling the development of thought,
and ceaselessly solving the problems that arise in man’s thinking.

Within the party, opposition and struggle between different
ideologies occur constantly; they are the reflection in the party
of the class contradictions and the contradictions between the
old and the new things in society. If in the party there were
neither contradictions nor ideological struggles to solve contradic¬
tions, the party’s life would come to an end.

Thus the point is already clear: Whether in simple or complex
forms of motion, whether in objective or ideological phenomena,
contradiction exists universally, exists in all processes. But does
contradiction also exist at the initial stage of every process?
Is there a movement in opposites in the process of development
of everything from beginning to end?

From the writings of Soviet philosophical circles in criticism
of the Deborin school, it can be seen that this school holds the
view that contradiction does not appear at the very beginning of
a process, but only at a certain stage of its development. Con¬
sequently, up to that moment, the development of the process
is due not to internal causes, but to external ones. In this way,
Deborin returns to the metaphysical theory of external causes
and of mechanism. Applying such a view in the analysis of
concrete problems, his school sees that under conditions in the
Soviet Union there are only differences but no contradictions
between the kulaks and the peasants in general, thus agreeing
entirely with Bukharin’s view. In analyzing the French Revolu-
hon, it holds that before the revolution there were only differences but no contradictions in the Third Estate composed of the
workers, the peasants, and the bourgeoisie.

These views of the Deborin school are anti-Marxist. This
school does not understand that every difference in the world
already contains a contradiction, that difference is contradiction.
There has been contradiction between labor and capital ever
since they came into being—only at first it was not yet intensified.
There is a difference between the workers and the peasants
even under the social conditions of the Soviet Union, and the
difference between them is contradiction—but, unlike that be¬
tween labor and capital, this contradiction will not become in¬
tensified into antagonism and will not assume the form of class
struggle. In the course of socialist construction the workers and
the peasants have formed a firm alliance and will gradually resolve
this contradiction in the process of development from socialism
to communism. This is a question of difference in the character
of contradictions, not a matter of the presence or absence of
contradictions. Contradiction is universal, absolute, existing in all
processes of the development of things and running through
all processes from beginning to end.

What is the emergence of a new process? It occurs when
the old unity and its constituent opposites yield place to a new
unity and its constituent opposites, and the new process then
emerges in place of the old. The old process is completed, and
the new one emerges. The new process in its turn contains a
new contradiction, and the history of the development of its
own contradiction begins.

Lenin pointed out that Marx in his Capital gave a model
analysis of the movement in opposites which runs through the
process of development of things from beginning to end. This is
the method that must be applied in studying the process of
development of all things. Lenin himself also correctly applied
it and adhered to it in all his writings.

“In his Capital, Marx first analyzes the simplest, most ordi¬
nary, fundamental, most common and everyday relation of bour¬
geois (commodity) society, a relation that is encountered bil¬
lions of times, viz., the exchange of commodities. In this very simple phenomenon (in this ‘cell’ of bourgeois society) analysis
reveals all the contradictions (or the germs of all the contra¬
dictions) of modern society. The subsequent exposition shows
us the development (both growth and movement) of these con¬
tradictions and of this society in the ^[sum total] of its individ¬
ual parts, from its beginning to its end.”

Having said this, Lenin continued: “Such must also be the
method of exposition (or study) of dialectics in general.” Chinese Communists must master this method before they
can correctly analyze the history and the present conditions of
the Chinese revolution, as well as define its perspectives.


III. The Particularity
of Contradiction


Contradiction exists in the process of development of all things,
and contradiction runs through the process of development of
each thing from beginning to end: This is the universality and
absoluteness of contradiction which we have discussed above.
Now we shall speak of the particularity and relativity of con¬
tradiction.

This problem should be studied from several angles. First,
the contradiction in each form of motion of matter has its
particularity. Man’s knowledge of matter is a knowledge of the
forms of motion of matter, because there is nothing in the
world apart from matter in motion and the motion of matter must
assume certain forms. In considering each form of motion of
matter, we must take into account the points which each has in
common with various other forms of motion. But it is especially
important, and it constitutes the basis of our knowledge of
things, to take into account the particular points of the motion
of matter, namely, the qualitative difference between it and other
forms of motion. Only when we have taken this into account
can we distinguish between things.

Any form of motion contains within itself its own particular
contradiction. This particular contradiction constitutes the par¬
ticular quality which distinguishes one thing from all others.
This is the internal cause or, as it may be called, the basis of the
fact that things in the world are different from one another
in a thousand and one ways. Many forms of motion exist in
nature: Mechanical motion, sound, light, heat, electricity, de¬
composition, combination, and so on. All these forms of motion
of matter are dependent upon one another as well as qualitatively
different from one another. The particular quality possessed by each form of motion of matter is determined by its own particu¬
lar contradiction. Such a condition exists not only in nature but
also in social and ideological phenomena. Every form of society,
every mode of thought has its particular contradiction and
particular quality.

The classification of scientific studies is based precisely upon
the particular contradictions inherent in their objects. Thus a
certain kind of contradiction peculiar to a certain field of phe¬
nomena constitutes the object of study of a certain branch of
science. For example, positive numbers and negative numbers in
mathematics; action and reaction in mechanics; positive and
negative electricity in physics; decomposition and combination
in chemistry; productive forces and relations of production, classes
and the struggle between the classes in social science; offense
and defense in military science; idealism and materialism, the
metaphysical outlook and the dialectical outlook in philosophy,
and so on. It is because each possesses a particular contradiction
and a particular quality that they become the objects of different
scientific studies. Of course, if we do not recognize the uni¬
versality of contradiction, we can in no way discover the uni¬
versal cause or universal basis of the development of the
motion of things; however, if we do not study the particularity of
contradiction, we can in no way determine the particular quality
of a thing that differs from that of other things, discover the
particular cause or particular basis of the development of the
motion of things, or distinguish between things, and mark out the
fields of scientific study.

According to the sequence in man’s process of knowing, there
is always a gradual extension from a knowledge of the individual
thing to a knowledge of things in general. It is always the case
that man can proceed to generalizations and know the common
qualities of various things only after he has known the particular
qualities of many different things. When man already knows such
common qualities, he uses this knowledge as a guide and goes
on studying various concrete things which have not yet been
studied or have not yet been thoroughly studied, so as to find out
their particular qualities. Only thus can he supplement, enrich, and develop his knowledge of the common qualities and prevent
it from becoming withered and petrified.

These are the two processes of knowing: One is from the par¬
ticular to the general, and the other is from the general to the par¬
ticular. Man’s knowledge always proceeds in this cyclical, recur¬
rent manner, and the turn of each cycle (if it conforms strictly to
scientific method) can raise man’s knowledge to a higher level
and continuously deepen it. The mistake of our dogmatists on
this question is: On the one hand, they do not understand that
we must study the particularity of contradiction and know the
particular qualities of individual things before we can know
adequately the universality of contradiction and the common
qualities of various things; and, on the other hand, they do not
understand that after we have known the common qualities of
things, we must go on studying those concrete things that have
not yet been thoroughly studied or have newly emerged. Our
dogmatists are lazybones; they refuse to make any painstaking
study of concrete things, but regard general truths as something
emerging out of the void, and turn them into purely abstract
formulas which people cannot grasp, thereby completely denying,
as well as reversing, the normal sequence in which man comes to
know truth. Nor do they understand the interconnection of the
two processes in man’s knowing, from the particular to the gen¬
eral and from the general to the particular; they do not under¬
stand the Marxist theory of knowledge at all.

It is necessary not only to study the particular contradiction
and the quality determined thereby in every great system of
forms of motion of matter, but also to study the particular
contradiction and the quality of every form of motion of matter
at each stage of its long course of development. In all forms of
motion, each process of development that is real and not imagined
is qualitatively different. Our study must lay emphasis on this
point and must start from it.

Qualitatively different contradictions can only be resolved by
qualitatively different methods. For example: The contradiction
between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is resolved by the
method of socialist revolution; the contradiction between the
great masses of the people and the feudal system is resolved by
the method of democratic revolution; the contradiction between
colonies and imperialism is resolved by the method of national
revolutionary war; the contradiction between the working class
and the peasantry in socialist society is resolved by the method
of collectivization and mechanization of agriculture; the contra¬
diction within the Communist Party is resolved by the method
of criticism and self-criticism; the contradiction between society
and nature is resolved by the method of developing the pro¬
ductive forces.

Processes change, old processes and old contradictions dis¬
appear, new processes and new contradictions emerge, and the
methods of resolving contradictions differ accordingly. In Russia
the contradictions resolved by the February Revolution and the
October Revolution, respectively, as well as the methods used
to resolve them were basically different. The use of different
methods to resolve different contradictions is a principle which
Marxist-Leninists must strictly observe. The dogmatists do not
observe this principle. They do not understand the difference
between the various revolutionary situations, and consequently
do not understand that different methods should be used to
resolve different contradictions; instead they uniformly adopt a
formula which they fancy to be unalterable and inflexibly apply
it everywhere. This can only bring setbacks to the revolution
or make a great mess of what originally could have been done
well.

In order to reveal the particularity of contradictions in their
totality as well as their interconnection in the process of develop¬
ment of things, that is, to reveal the quality of the process of
development of things, we must reveal the particularity of each
aspect of the contradiction in the process; otherwise it is impos¬
sible to reveal the quality of the process. This is also a matter
to which we must pay the utmost attention in our study.

In the process of its development, a great thing or event con¬
tains many contradictions. For instance, in the process of China’s
bourgeois-democratic revolution there are the contradiction
between the various oppressed classes in Chinese society and imperialism, the contradiction between the great masses of the
people and feudalism, the contradiction between the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie, the contradiction between the peasantry
together with the urban petty bourgeoisie on the one hand, and
the bourgeoisie on the other, the contradiction between various
reactionary ruling blocs, etc. The situation is exceedingly complex.
Not only does each of these contradictions have its own particu¬
larity, and they cannot be treated uniformly, but each of the
two aspects of every contradiction also has its own characteristics,
and they cannot be treated uniformly. We who work for the
Chinese revolution should understand not only the particularity
of each of the contradictions in the light of their totality, that is,
from the interconnection of those contradictions, but also the
totality of the contradictions by undertaking a study of their
aspects. To understand each aspect of a contradiction is to under¬
stand the definite position each aspect occupies, the concrete
form in which it comes into the relation of mutual dependence
and contradiction with its opposite, and the concrete means by
which it struggles with its opposite when the two are mutually
dependent and yet contradictory, as well as when the mutual
dependence breaks up. The study of these problems is a matter
of the utmost importance. Lenin was expressing this very idea
when he said that the most essential thing in Marxism, the living
soul of Marxism, is the concrete analysis of concrete conditions. 10
Our dogmatists, contrary to Lenin’s teaching, never use their
brains to analyze anything concretely; in their writings and
speeches they always strike the keynote of the “eight-legged
essay” which is void of any content, and have brought about
a very bad style of work in our party.

In studying a problem, we must guard against subjectivity,
one-sidedness, and superficiality. What is called subjectivity con¬
sists of not looking at a problem objectively, that is, not looking
at it from the materialist viewpoint; this I have discussed in
my essay On Practice , u What is called one-sidedness consists of
not looking at a problem as a whole. For example, understanding
only China but not Japan; understanding only the Communist
Party but not the Kuomintang, understanding only the proletariat but not the bourgeoisie, understanding only the peasants
but not the landlords, understanding only the favorable condi¬
tions but not the adverse conditions, understanding only the past
but not the future, understanding only the unit but not the
totality, understanding only the defects but not the achievements,
understanding only the plaintiff but not the defendant, under¬
standing only revolutionary work underground but not revolu¬
tionary work in the open, and so on. In a word, not understanding
the characteristics of each aspect of a contradiction. This is called
looking at a problem one-sidedly. Or it may be called seeing only
the part but not the whole, seeing only the trees but not the
woods. As a result of this, it is impossible to find the methods
for resolving contradictions; it is impossible to accomplish the
tasks of the revolution; it is impossible to do the assigned work
well; and it is impossible to develop correctly the ideological
struggle in the party.

Discussing military science, Sun Tzu said: “Know the enemy
and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles without
disaster”; 12 he was referring to the two sides in a battle. Wei
Cheng of the T’ang dynasty said: “To hear both sides makes
you enlightened, and to hear only one side makes you be¬
nighted”; 13 he also understood that one-sidedness is wrong. Yet
our comrades often tend to be one-sided when they look at
problems; such people will often run up against snags. In Water
Margin, 1 * Sung Chiang launched three attacks on Chu village
and was twice defeated because he had no clear knowledge of
the conditions and applied the wrong methods. Later he changed
his methods and started by investigating the situation. Thus he
learned about the intertwining roads; disrupted the alliance
between the Li, Hu, and Chu villages; and using a strategem
similar to that of the Trojan Horse in foreign legends, secretly
infiltrated his own soldiers in disguise into the enemy’s camp and
won victory on the third occasion. There are numerous examples
of materialist dialectics in Water Margin, and the episode of the
three attacks on Chu village can be considered the best.

Lenin said: “In order really to know an object we must em¬
brace, study, all its sides, all connections and ‘mediations.’ We shall never achieve this completely, but the demand for all-
sidedness is a safeguard against mistakes and rigidity.” 15 We
should remember his words. Superficiality means to consider nei¬
ther the characteristics of the contradiction as a whole nor the
characteristics of each of its aspects, to deny the necessity of
penetrating into things to study minutely the characteristics of
the contradiction, but to take a glance from a distance and,
having roughly noticed some features of the contradiction,
wish to start resolving it (answering questions, settling differ¬
ences, handling work, directing military operations). Such a way
of doing things never leads to anything but trouble. The reason
why our comrades suffering from dogmatism and empiricism have
made mistakes is precisely because their way of looking at things
is subjective, one-sided, and superficial. One-sidedness and super¬
ficiality are also subjectivity, because while all objective things
are in reality interrelated and have an inner necessity, some
people do not mirror these conditions as they are but only look
at things one-sidedly or superficially, knowing neither their
interrelationship nor their inner necessity. Such a method is
therefore subjective.

Not only must we pay attention to the specific characteristics
arising from the interconnection and the conditions of the various
aspects of the movement in opposites of the whole process of the
development of things, but we must also pay attention to the
specific characteristics of every stage in the process of develop¬
ment.

The basic contradiction in the process of development of
things, and the quality of the process determined by this basic
contradiction, will not disappear until the process is completed;
but the conditions of each stage in the long process of develop¬
ment of things often differ from those of another stage. The
reason for this is that, while the nature of the basic contradic¬
tion in the development of things and the quality of the process
have not changed, yet at the various stages in the long process of
development, the basic contradiction assumes an increasingly
intensified form. Besides, among the numerous big and small con¬
tradictions determined or influenced by the basic contradiction, some become intensified, some are temporarily or partially re¬
solved or mitigated, and some emerge anew; consequently the
process reveals itself as consisting of different stages. If people
do not pay attention to the stages in the process of development
of a thing, they cannot deal properly with its contradictions.

For example: At the time when capitalism of the era of free
competition developed into imperialism, there was no change
in the character of the two classes in fundamental contradiction,
the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, or in the capitalist nature of
such a society. However, the contradiction between these two
classes became intensified, the contradiction between monopoly
capital and non-monopoly capital emerged, the contradiction
between metropolitan countries and colonies became intensified,
and the contradiction between the capitalist countries, that is,
the contradiction caused by the unevenness of their development,
manifested itself in a particularly acute way, thus bringing about
the special stage of capitalism, the stage of imperialism. The rea¬
son why Leninism is Marxism of the era of imperialism and of the
proletarian revolution is that Lenin and Stalin have correctly
explained these contradictions and correctly formulated the theory
and tactics of the proletarian revolution for resolving them.

An examination of the process of the bourgeois-democratic
revolution in China, which began with the Revolution of 1911, 18
also reveals several special stages. In particular, the revolution
in the period of its bourgeois leadership and the revolution in
the period of its proletarian leadership are marked off from each
other as two vastly different historical stages. That is, the leader¬
ship of the proletariat has basically changed the physiognomy
of the revolution, and led to a readjustment in class relations, a
tremendous stirring of the peasant revolution, a thoroughness
in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, the possibility
of the transition from democratic revolution to Socialist revolu¬
tion, and so on. All this could not possibly happen in the period
when the revolution was under bourgeois leadership. Although
there was no change in the nature of the basic contradiction of the
whole process — in the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, democratic-
revolutionary nature of the process (with the semi-colonial, semi-feudal nature as the other aspect) — yet in this long period of
some twenty years it has gone through several stages of develop¬
ment. Such great events as the failure of the Revolution of 1911
and the establishment of the regime of the Northern warlords,
the establishment of the first national united front and the
Revolution of 1924-27, 17 the breaking up of the united front and
the passing of the bourgeoisie into the counter-revolutionary
camp, the wars between the new warlords, the agrarian revolu¬
tionary war, the establishment of the second national united front
and the Anti-Japanese War. 18 These stages contain such specific
conditions as the intensification of some contradictions (for
example, the agrarian revolutionary war and the Japanese inva¬
sion of the four Northeastern provinces); the partial or temporary
solution of other contradictions (for example, the liquidation
of the Northern warlords and our confiscation of the land of
the landlords); and the fresh emergence of still other contra¬
dictions (for example, the struggle between the new warlords,
the landlords’ recovery of their land after our loss of the revolu¬
tionary bases in the south).

To study the particularity of the contradictions at every stage
in the process of development of things, we must not only observe
them in their interconnection and their totality, but we must
consider each aspect of the contradiction at each stage of its
development.

Take the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, for instance.
As to the Kuomintang: In the period of the first united front it
was revolutionary and vigorous and represented an alliance of
various classes in the democratic revolution, because it carried
out Sun Yat-sen’s 19 three cardinal policies of alliance with Russia,
co-operation with the Communists, and assistance to the workers
and peasants. After 1927, the Kuomintang turned in the opposite
direction and became the reactionary bloc of the landlords and
the big bourgeoisie. After the Sian Incident 20 in December, 1936.
it made another turn and began to move in the direction of
cessation of the civil war and alliance with the Communist Party
in joint opposition to Japanese imperialism. Such are the char¬
acteristics of the Kuomintang in its three stages. The formation of these characteristics is, of course, due to various causes.

As to the Chinese Communist Party in the period of the first
united front, it was a party in its childhood and courageously
led the Revolution of 1924-27, but it revealed itself as immature
in the understanding of the nature, tasks, and methods of the
revolution. Consequently, Ch'en Tuhsiuism, 21 which appeared
in the last period of this revolution, was able to have its effect
and caused the defeat of this revolution. After 1927, the Com¬
munist Party again courageously led the agrarian revolutionary
war and created the revolutionary army and revolutionary bases;
however it also made mistakes of adventurism which brought seri¬
ous losses to both the army and the bases. Since 1935, it has
rectified these mistakes and led the new anti-Japanese united
front; this great struggle is now developing. At the present stage
the Communist Party is a party that has gone through the test
of two revolutions and has acquired a rich store of experience.
Such are the characteristics of the Chinese Communist Party in
its three stages.

The formation of these characteristics is also due to various
causes. Without studying these characteristics, we cannot under¬
stand the specific interrelations of the two parties at the various
stages of their development: The establishment of the united
front, the breaking up of the united front, and the establishment
of another united front. But in order to study the various char¬
acteristics of the two parties, we must—this is even more funda¬
mental-study the class basis of the two parties, the resultant con¬
tradictions between the two parties and other forces during
different periods. For example, in the period of its first alliance
with the Communist Party, the Kuomintang on the one hand
stood in contradiction to foreign imperialism and therefore op¬
posed imperialism; while on the other hand it stood in contra¬
diction to the great masses of the people at home, and, though it
verbally promised to give many benefits to the toiling people, in
reality it gave them very few or even none at all. In the period
when it carried on the anti-Communist war, it collaborated with
imperialism and feudalism to oppose the great masses of the peo¬
ple, writing off all the benefits which the great masses of the people had won in the revolution and thus intensifying its own con¬
tradiction with the great masses of the people. In the present pe¬
riod of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang, standing in con¬
tradiction to Japanese imperialism, wants on the one hand to ally
itself with the Communist Party, while on the other it does not
slacken its struggle against, and its oppression of, the Communist
Party and the Chinese people.

As to the Communist Party, no matter in which period, it
always sides with the great masses of the people to oppose impe¬
rialism and feudalism; in the present period of the Anti-Japanese
War, because the Kuomintang shows itself in favor of resisting
Japan, the Communist Party has adopted a mild policy toward
it and toward the domestic feudal forces. Because of these
conditions, an alliance of the two parties is brought about at one
time, and a struggle at another; and even during the period of
the alliance between the two parties, there also exists a compli¬
cated state of affairs in which alliance and struggle take place
at the same time. If we do not study the characteristics of these
aspects of the contradiction, we shall not only fail to understand
the relation between each of the two parties and other forces,
but also fail to understand the interrelation of the two parties.

From this it can be seen that in studying the specific nature
of any kind of contradiction—contradiction in various forms of
motion of matter, contradiction in various forms of motion in
every process of development, each aspect of the contradiction
in every process of development, contradiction at the various
stages of every process of development, and each aspect of the
contradiction at the various stages of development—in studying
the specific nature of all these contradictons, we must be free
from any taint of subjective arbitrariness and must make a con¬
crete analysis of them. Apart from a concrete analysis there can be
no knowledge of the specific nature of any contradiction. We must
at all times bear in mind Lenin’s words: the concrete analysis
of concrete conditions.

Marx and Engels were the first to supply us with an excellent
model of such concrete analysis.

When Marx and Engels applied the law of contradiction in things to the study of the process of social history, they saw the
contradiction between the productive forces and the relations
of production; they saw the contradiction between the exploiting
class and the exploited class, as well as the contradiction pro¬
duced thereby between the economic basis and its superstruc¬
tures such as politics and ideology; and they saw how these
contradictions inevitably lead to different social revolutions in
different class societies.

When Marx applied this law to the study of the economic
structure of capitalist society, he saw that the basic contradic¬
tion of this society is the contradiction between the social charac¬
ter of production and the private character of ownership. This
contradiction manifests itself in the contradiction between the
organized character of production in individual enterprises and
the unorganized character of production in society as a whole.
The class manifestation of this contradiction is the contradiction
between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

Because of the vastness of the scope of things and the limit¬
lessness of their development, what is universality in one case
is in another changed into particularity. On the other hand, what
in one case is particularity is in another changed into univer¬
sality. The contradiction contained in the capitalist system be¬
tween the socialization of production and the private ownership
of the means of production is common to all countries where
capitalism exists and develops; as far as capitalism is concerned,
this constitutes the universality of contradiction. However, this
contradiction in capitalism is something pertaining to a certain
historical stage in the development of class society in general;
as far as the contradiction between the productive forces and the
relations of production in class society in general is concerned,
this constitutes the particularity of contradiction. But when Marx
revealed by analysis the particularity of every contradiction in
capitalist society, he simultaneously expounded more profoundly,
more adequately, and more completely the universality of the
contradiction between the productive forces and the relations
of production in class society in general.

As the particular is connected with the universal, and as not only the particularity of contradition but also the universality of
contradiction is inherent in everything, universality thus existing
in particularity, so, when we study a certain object we ought to try
to discover both of these aspects and their interconnection, to
discover the two aspects of particularity and universality within
the object as well as their interconnection, and to discover the
interconnection of this object with the many objects outside it.
When Stalin explained the historical roots of Leninism in his
famous work. Foundations of Leninism , 22 he analyzed the inter¬
national situation in which Leninism was born, and the various
contradictions in capitalism which had reached their extreme
under the conditions of imperialism. He analyzed how these
contradiction made the proletarian revolution a question of
immediate practice, and created favorable conditions for a direct
onslaught upon capitalism. In addition, he analyzed the reasons
why Russia became the home of Leninism, how tsarist Russia
represented the focus of all the contradictions of imperialism,
and why the Russian proletariat could become the vanguard of
the international revolutionary proletariat. In this way, Stalin
analyzed the universality of the contradiction in imperialism,
showing how Leninism is Marxism of the era of imperialism and
the proletarian revolution, and analyzed the particularity of the
imperialism of tsarist Russia in the contradiction in general, show¬
ing how Russia became the birthplace of the theory and tactics of
the proletarian revolution and how in such a particularity is con¬
tained the universality of contradiction. This kind of analysis by
Stalin serves as a model in understanding the particularity and
the universality of contradiction and their interconnection.

On the question of applying dialectics to the study of objec¬
tive phenomena, Marx and Engels, and likewise Lenin and Stalin,
have always taught people that they should not be tainted with
any subjective arbitrariness and must discover, from the concrete
conditions inherent in the objective actual movements, the con¬
crete contradictions in those phenomena, the concrete role of
each of the aspects of the contradictions, and the concrete inter¬
relation of the contradictions. Because they have not taken such
an attitude in study, our dogmatists can never be in the right. We must take warning from the failure of dogmatism, and learn
to acquire such an attitude in study—there is no other method.

The relation between the universality of contradiction and the
particularity of contradiction is the relation between the common
character and the individual character of contradictions. By
common character we mean that contradiction exists in all proc¬
esses and runs through all processes from beginning to end.
Contradictions are movements, are things, are processes, are
thoughts. To deny the contradiction in things is to deny all.
This is a universal principle which admits of no exceptions, in
either ancient or modem times, in China or foreign countries.
Hence the common character or absoluteness. But this com¬
mon character is contained in all individual characters; without
individual character there can be no common character. If
all individual characters were removed, what common char¬
acter would remain? Because each of the contradictions is
particular, their individual characters are formed. All indi¬
vidual characters exist conditionally and temporarily, hence
they are relative.

This principle of common character and individual character,
of absoluteness and relativity, is the quintessence of the problem
of the contradiction in things; not to understand it is equivalent
to abandoning dialectics.

IV. The Principal Contradiction and
the Principal Aspect of a
Con tradiction

As regards the problem of the particularity of contradiction,
there are still two sides which must be specially singled out for
analysis, that is, the principal contradiction and the principal
aspect of a contradiction.

In the process of development of a complex thing, many
contradictions exist; among these, one is necessarily the principal
contradiction the existence and development of which deter¬
mine or influence the existence and development of other con¬
tradictions.

For example, in capitalist society, the two opposing forces in
contradiction, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, form the princi¬
pal contradiction. This principal contradiction determines and
influences the other contradictions—for example, the contradiction
between the remnant feudal class and the bourgeoisie, between
the rural petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie, between the
proletariat and the rural petty bourgeoisie, between the liberal
bourgeoisie and the monopolistic bourgeoisie, between bourgeois
democracy and bourgeois fascism, between the capitalist coun¬
tries themselves, between imperialism and the colonies, etc.

In semi-colonial countries like China, the relationship between
the principal contradiction and non-principal contradictions pre¬
sents a complicated situation.

When imperialism wages a war of aggression against such »
country, the various classes in that country, apart from lie
traitors, can temporarily unite to wage a national war against
imperialism. At such a time, the contradiction between im¬
perialism and that country becomes the principal contradiction, while all the contradictions among the various classes within
that country (including the principal contradiction between the
feudal system and the great masses of the people) are relegated
temporarily to a secondary or subordinate position. Such was the
case in China in the Opium War of 1840, 23 the Sino-Japanese
War of 1894, 24 the Boxer War of 1900, 26 and it is the case in the
present Sino-Japanese War.

But in another situation, the relative positions of contradic¬
tions undergo a change. When imperialism does not apply the
pressure of war, but adopts comparatively mild forms—political,
economic, cultural, etc.—to carry on its oppression, the ruling
classes in the semi-colonial countries will capitulate to imperial¬
ism; the two will form an alliance for the joint oppression of
the great masses of the people. At such a time, the great masses
of the people often adopt the form of civil war to oppose the
alliance of imperialism and the feudal class, while imperialism
often adopts indirect methods in helping the reactionaries in the
semi-colonial countries to oppress the people without taking
direct action. This reveals the special sharpness of the internal
contradiction. Such has been the case in China in the revolu¬
tionary war of 1911, the revolutionary war of 1924-27, and the
ten years’ agrarian revolutionary war since 1927. Furthermore,
the civil wars between the various reactionary ruling blocs in
the semi-colonial countries, e.g., the wars between the warlords
in China, also belong to this category.

When a revolutionary civil war reaches the point of funda¬
mentally threatening the existence of imperialism and its jackals
—the domestic reactionaries—imperialism will often adopt meth¬
ods other than those mentioned above in an endeavor to main¬
tain its rule. It either tries to split up the revolutionary front
from within or sends armed forces directly to help the domestic
reactionaries. At such times, foreign imperialism and the domestic
reactionaries stand completely in the open at one pole while the
great masses of the people stand at another, thus forming the
principal contradiction which determines or influences the de¬
velopment of other contradictions. The aid given by various
capitalist countries to the Russian reactionaries after the October Revolution is a case of armed intervention. Chiang Kai-shek’s
betrayal in 1927 28 is a case of disintegrating the revolutionary
front.

But whatever happens, there is no doubt at all that at every
stage in the process of development, only one principal contra¬
diction plays the leading role.

From this it can be seen that if in any process a number of
contradictions exist, only one of them is the principal contradic¬
tion, playing the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy
a secondary or subordinate position. Thus, in studying any
process—if it is a complicated process in which more than two
contradictions exist—we must devote our whole energy to dis¬
covering its principal contradiction. Once this principal contra¬
diction is grasped, any problem can be solved readily. This is
the method Marx taught us when he studied capitalist society.
When Lenin and Stalin studied imperialism and the general
crisis of capitalism, and when they studied Soviet economy, they
also taught us this method. Thousands of scholars and practical
workers do not understand this method, with the result that,
bewildered as if lost in a sea of mist, they cannot find the crux
of a problem and naturally cannot find the method of resolving
contradictions.

As we said above, we cannot treat all the contradictions in
a process as equal, but must distinguish between the principal
and the secondary contradictions, and pay particular attention
to grasping the principal one. But, in any contradiction, whether
principal or secondary, can we treat the two contradictory aspects
as equal?

No, we cannot. In any contradiction, at any time, the develop¬
ment of the contradictory aspects is uneven. Sometimes there
seems to be a balance of forces, but that is only a temporary and
relative state; the basic state is unevenness. Of the two contra¬
dictory aspects, one must be the principal and the other sec¬
ondary. The principal aspect is the one which plays the leading
role in the contradiction. The quality of a thing is mainly deter¬
mined by the principal aspect of the contradiction that has
taken the dominant position.

But this state is not fixed; the principal and the non-principal
aspects of a contradiction transform themselves into each other
and the quality of a thing changes accordingly. In a certain proc¬
ess or at a certain stage in the development of a contradiction,
the principal aspect is A and the non-principal aspect is B; at an¬
other stage of development or in another process of development,
the roles are reversed—a change determined by the extent of the
increase and decrease, respectively, in the intensity of the struggle
of the two aspects of the contradiction in the development of a
thing.

We often speak of “the superseding of the old by the new.”
The superseding of the old by the new is the universal, forever
inviolable law of the world. A thing transforms itself into some¬
thing else according to its nature and the conditions under which
it finds itself and through different forms of leap; that is the
process of the superseding of the old by the new. Everything
contains a contradiction between its new aspect and its old aspect,
which constitutes a series of intricate struggles. As a result of
these struggles, the new aspect grows and rises to become the
thing that dominates, while the old aspect dwindles and becomes
the thing that gradually approaches extinction. And the moment
the new aspect has won the dominant position over the old aspect,
the quality of the old thing changes into the quality of the new
thing. From this it can be seen that the quality of a thing is
mainly determined by the principal aspect of the contradiction
that has won the dominant position. When the principal aspect
of the contradiction that has won the dominant position under¬
goes a change, the quality of a thing changes accordingly.

In capitalist society, capitalism transformed itself from a force
which occupied a subordinate position in the old era of feudal
society into one that has won the dominant position, and the
nature of society has also changed from feudal to capitalist. In
the new era of capitalist society, feudal forces have been trans¬
formed from forces originally in the dominant position into subor¬
dinate forces, and then they gradually approached extinction;
such is the case, for example, in Britain and France. With the
development of the productive forces, the bourgeoisie has been transformed from a new class, playing a progressive role, into
an old class, playing a reactionary role, until it is finally over¬
thrown by the proletariat and is transformed into a class which is
deprived of its private means of production and of its power, and
which will then also gradually approach extinction. The prole¬
tariat, which is much more numerous than the bourgeoisie, and
which grows up simultaneously with the bourgeoisie but is under
its rule, is a new force. From its initial position subordinate to
the bourgeoisie, it gradually grows stronger and becomes an
independent class playing a leading role in history until finally
it seizes political power and becomes the ruling class. At such
a time, the nature of society changes from that of the old capital¬
ist society into that of the new socialist society. This is the path
that the Soviet Union has already traversed and that all other
countries inevitably will traverse.

As regards the situation in China, while imperialism occupies
the principal position in the contradiction which makes her a
semi-colony, and oppresses the Chinese people, China has
changed from an independent country into a semi-colony. But
this state of affairs inevitably will change. In the struggle between
the two sides, the strength of the Chinese people, which grows
under the leadership of the proletariat, inevitably will change
China from a semi-colony into an independent country, whereas
imperialism will be overthrown and the old China will inevitably
change into a new China.

The change of the old China into a new China also involves
a change in the relation between the old forces of China’s feudal¬
ism and the new forces of her people. The old feudal landlord
class will be overthrown, and from being the ruler it will become
the ruled; this class will also gradually approach extinction.
Under the leadership of the protetariat the people will, from
being the ruled, become the rulers. At the same time, the nature
of Chinese society will undergo a change—that is, the old, semi¬
colonial and semi-feudal society will change into a new, demo¬
cratic society.

Instances of such mutual transformations are found in our
past experience. The Manchu dynasty, 27 which had ruled China for nearly three hundred years, was overthrown during the Revo¬
lution of 1911, while the Revolutionary League under Sun Yat-
sen’s leadership won victory for a time. In the revolutionary war
of 1924-27, the revolutionary forces in the South, the alliance
between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, grew from
weakness to strength and won victory in the Northern Expedi¬
tion, 28 while the Northern warlords, once all-powerful, were over¬
thrown. In 1927, the people’s forces under the leadership of the
Communist Party, suffering from the attacks of the Kuomintang
reactionary forces, became very weak, but having eliminated
opportunism within their ranks they gradually became stronger
once more. In the revolutionary bases under the leadership of
the Communist Party, the peasants have transformed themselves
from being the ruled into the rulers, while the landlords have
undergone an opposite transformation. It is always in such a
manner that the new displaces the old in the world, that the
old is superseded by the new, that the old is eliminated and the
new is brought forth, or that the old is thrown off and the new
ushered in.

At certain times in the revolutionary struggle, difficulties out¬
weigh advantages; at such times, difficulties constitute the princi¬
pal aspect of the contradiction and advantages the secondary
aspect. But through the efforts of revolutionaries, difficulties can
be gradually overcome, an advantageous new situation is created,
and the difficult situation yields place to the advantageous one.
Such was the case after the failure of the revolution in China in
1927 and during the Long March of the Chinese Red Army. 29
In the present Sino-Japanese War, China is again in a difficult
position; but we can change this state of affairs and bring about
9 fundamental change in the situation of both China and Japan.
Conversely, advantages can also be transformed into difficulties,
If the revolutionaries make mistakes. The victory of the Revolu-
hon of 1924-27 turned into a defeat. The revolutionary bases that
bad grown in the southern provinces after 1927 all suffered de¬
feat in 1934.

Such also is the contradiction in our studies when we pass
h°in ignorance to knowledge. At the very beginning of our study of Marxism, our ignorance or scanty knowledge of Marxi
stands in contradiction to knowledge of Marxism. But as a res
of industrious study, ignorance can be transformed into knowlj
edge, scanty knowledge into considerable knowledge, and blind
ness in the use of Marxism into its masterly application.

Some people think that there are contradictions different fro
this. For example: In the contradiction between the product!
forces and the relations of production, the productive forces t
the principal aspect; in the contradiction between theory a
practice, practice is the principal aspect; in the contradicti
between the economic base and its superstructure, the economf
base is the principal aspect; and there is no change in the
respective positions. This is the view of mechanistic mati
rialism, and not of dialectical materialism. True, the produr
tive forces, practice, and the economic base generally
fest themselves in the principal and decisive role; whoev
does not admit this, is not a materialist. But under certain con
tions, such aspects as the relations of production, theory, and
superstructure, in turn, manifest themselves in the principal a
decisive role; this must also be admitted. When the productive
forces cannot be developed unless the relations of production
are changed, the change in the relations of production plays the
principal and decisive role. When, as Lenin put it, “without
revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement,
the creation and advocacy of the revolutionary theory play t
principal and decisive role. When certain work (this applies
any work) is to be done but there is as yet no directive, meth
plan, or policy, defining the directive, method, plan, or poli
is the principal and decisive factor. When the superstructure ,
politics, culture, and so on hinders the development of the e
nomic base, political and cultural reforms become the princi^
and decisive factors.

In saying this, are we running counter to materialism? W f
are not, because we recognize that in the development of hist
as a whole material things determine spiritual things, social e
ence determines social consciousness. But at the same time
also recognize and must recognize the reaction of spiritual thing the reaction of social consciousness on social existence, and the
reaction of the superstructure on the economic base. This is not
running counter to materialism; on the contrary, this is avoiding
mechanistic materialism and firmly upholding dialectical ma¬
terialism.

If, in studying the problem of the particularity of contradiction,
we do not study these two conditions—the principal contradiction
and the non-principal contradiction in the process, as well as the
principal aspect and the non-principal aspect of a contradiction—
that is, if we do not study the distinctive character of these two
conditions of contradiction, we shall get bogged down in abstract
studies and shall not be able concretely to understand the condi¬
tion of a contradiction, and consequently we shall not be able to
find the correct method of solving the contradiction. The distinc¬
tive character or particularity of these two conditions of contra¬
diction represents the unevenness of the contradictory forces.
There is nothing in the world that is absolutely even in its de¬
velopment, and we must oppose the theory of even development
or the theory of equilibrium. At the same time, the concrete
conditions of a contradiction and the change in the principal
and non-principal aspects of a contradiction in its process of
development, show precisely the force of the new things in super¬
seding the old. The study of various conditions of unevenness in
the contradiction, the study of the principal contradiction and
the non-principal contradiction, of the principal aspect of the
contradiction and the non-principal aspect of the contradiction,
constitutes one of the important methods by which a revolu¬
tionary political party determines correctly its political and mili¬
tary strategic and tactical directives. All Communists should
note this.

V. The Identity and Struggle of the
Aspects of a Contradiction


Having understood the problem of the universality and par¬
ticularity of contradiction, we must proceed to study the prob¬
lem of the identity and struggle of the aspects of a contradiction.

Identity, unity, coincidence, interpermeation, interpenetration,
interdependence (or interdependence for existence), interconnec¬
tion or co-operation—all these different terms mean the same
thing and refer to the following two conditions: First, each of the
two aspects of every contradiction in the process of development
of a thing finds the presupposition of its existence in its opposite
aspect, and both coexist in an entity; second, each of the two
contradictory aspects, according to given conditions, tends to
transform itself into its opposite aspect. This is what is meant
by identity.

Lenin said: “Dialectics is such a theory: It studies how the
opposites can be identical and how they become identical (how
they change and become identical)—under what conditions they
transform themselves into each other and become identical—why
the human mind should not regard these opposites as dead, rigid
things, but as living, conditional, changeable things which trans¬
form themselves into each other.”

What is the meaning of this passage from Lenin?

The contradictory aspects in every process exclude each other,
struggle with each other, and are opposed to each other. Such
aspects of a contradictory nature are contained without exception
in the processes of all things in the world and in human thought.
A simple process has only one pair of opposites; a complex
process has more than one pair of opposites. Various pairs of opposites in turn become opposed to one another. In this way
all things in the objective world and human thought are formed
and impelled to move.

But if this is so, there is an utter lack of identity or unity.
How then can we speak of identity or unity?

The reason is that the contradictory aspects cannot exist in
isolation. Without the other aspect which is opposed to it, each
aspect loses the condition of its existence. Just imagine, can any
of the aspects of all the contradictory things or of contradictory
concepts in the human mind exist independently? Without life,
there would be no death; without death, there would also be no
life. Without “above,” there would be no “below”; without
“below,” there would also be no “above.” Without misfortune,
there would be no good fortune; without good fortune, there
would also be no misfortune. Without easiness, there would be
no difficulty; without difficulty, there would also be no easiness.
Without landlords, there would be no tenant-peasants; without
tenant-peasants, there would also be no landlords. Without the
bourgeoisie, there would be no proletariat; without the prole¬
tariat, there would also be no bourgeoisie. Without imperialist
oppression of the nations, there would be no colonies and semi¬
colonies; without colonies and semi-colonies, there would also
be no imperialist oppression of the nations.

All opposite elements are like this: Because of certain con¬
ditions, they are opposed to each other on the one hand and
they are interconnected, interpenetrated, interpermeated, and
interdependent on the other hand; this character is identity. All
contradictory aspects, because of certain conditions, are char¬
acterized by non-identity; hence, they are spoken of as contra¬
dictory. But they are also characterized by identity; hence, they
are interconnected. When Lenin says that dialectics studies “how
the opposites can be identical,” he is referring to such a state of
affairs. How can they be identical? Because of the condition of
mutual sustenance of each other’s existence. This is the first
meaning of identity.

But is it enough to say merely that the contradictory aspects
mutually sustain each other’s existence, that there is identity between them and consequently they can coexist in an entity?
No, it is not enough. The matter does not end with the inter¬
dependence of the two contradictory aspects on each other for
their existence; more important is the transformation of the con¬
tradictory things into each other. That is to say, each of the two
contradictory aspects within a thing, because of certain condi¬
tions, tends to transform itself into its opposite, to transfer itself
to the opposite position. This is the second meaning of the
identity of contradiction.

Why is there also identity? You see, by means of revolution,
the proletariat, once the ruled, transforms itself into the ruler,
while the bourgeoisie, originally the ruler, is transformed into the
ruled, transferred to the position originally occupied by its oppo¬
site. This has already taken place in the Soviet Union, and will
take place throughout the world. I should like to ask: If there is
no interconnection and identity of opposites under certain condi¬
tions, can such a change take place?

The Kuomintang, which played a certain positive role at a
certain stage in modern Chinese history, has since 1927 trans¬
formed itself into a counter-revolutionary party, because of its
inherent class nature and the temptations of imperialism (these
being the conditions); but, because of the intensification of the
contradiction between China and Japan and the policy of the
united front of the Communist Party (these being the condi¬
tions), it has been compelled to agree to resist Japan. Contra¬
dictory things change into one another; in this respect there is a
certain identity.

The agrarian revolution we have carried out is already and
will be such a process in which the land-owning landlord class is
transformed into a class deprived of its land, while the peasants,
once deprived of their land, transform themselves into small
holders of land. The haves and the have-nots, gain and loss, are
interconnected because of certain conditions; there is identity
of the two sides. Under socialism, the system of the peasants’
private ownership will in turn be transformed into the public
ownership of socialist agriculture; this has already taken place
in the Soviet Union, and will take place throughout the world.

Between private property and public property there is a bridge
leading from the one to the other, which in philosophy is called
identity, or transformation into each other, or interpermeation.

To consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat or the peo¬
ple’s dictatorship is precisely to prepare the conditions for
liquidating such a dictatorship and advancing to the higher stage
of abolishing all state systems. To establish and develop the
Communist Party is precisely to prepare the condition for abolish¬
ing the Communist Party and all party systems. To establish the
revolutionary army under the leadership of the Communist Party
and to carry on the revolutionary war is precisely to prepare the
condition for abolishing war forever. These contradictory things
are at the same time complementary.

As everybody knows, war and peace transform themselves
into each other. War is transformed into peace: For example, the
first World War was transformed into the post-war peace; the
civil war in China has now also ceased and internal peace has
come about. Peace is transformed into war: For example, the
Kuomintang-Communist co-operation of 1927 was transformed
into war, and the peaceful world situation today may also be
transformed into a second world war. Why? Because in a class
society such contradictory things as war and peace are character¬
ized by identity under certain conditions.

All contradictory things are interconnected, and they not only
coexist in an entity under certain conditions, but also transform
themselves into each other under certain conditions—this is the
whole meaning of the identity of contradictions. This is exactly
what Lenin meant when he said: “. .. how they become identical
(how they change and become identical)—under what conditions
they transform themselves into each other and become identical.

Why should the human mind “not regard such opposites as
dead, rigid things but as living, conditional, changeable things
which transform themselves into each other”? Because that is just
what objective things are. The unity or identity of the contra¬
dictory aspects in objective things is never dead, rigid, but living,
conditional, changeable, temporary, relative; all contradictory aspects transform themselves, under certain conditions, into their
opposites. Such a state of affairs, reflected in human thought,
becomes the materialist-dialectical world outlook of Marxism.
Only the present-day reactionary ruling classes (like those of the
past), as well as metaphysics, which is in their service, regard
opposites not as living, conditional, changeable things that trans¬
form themselves into each other, but as dead, rigid things. They
propagate this erroneous view everywhere to delude the masses
of the people, and thereby attain the aim of perpetuating their
rule. The task of the Communists is precisely to expose such
erroneous reactionary and metaphysical thought, to propagate
the dialectics inherent in things, and to hasten the transformation
of things, to attain the aim of the revolution.

By the identity of contradiction under certain conditions we
mean that the contradictions we are talking about are real con¬
tradictions, concrete contradictions, and that the transformation
of contradictory aspects into each other is also real, concrete.
There are innumerable transformations in mythology, for ex¬
ample, Kuafu’s racing with the sun in the Book of Mountains
and Seas, 32 Yi’s shooting down of nine suns in Huai-Nan Tzu 33
Monkey’s 72 metamorphoses in the Pilgrimage to the West 34
the numerous episodes of ghosts and foxes metamorphosed into
human beings in Strange Tales from the Carefree Studio. 33 The
transformation of opposites into each other as told in these
legends is the sort of childish, imaginary, subjectively fancied
transformation that is called forth among men by the innumer¬
able transformations of complicated, real contradictions into each
other, and is not a concrete transformation as manifested in


concrete contradictions. Marx said: “All mythology masters and
dominates and shapes the forces of nature in and through the
imagination, hence it disappears as soon as man gains mastery
over the forces of nature.” 38 Although stories of endless meta¬
morphoses in such mythology (and also in nursery tales) can
delight people because in them man’s conquest of the forces of
nature, etc., is imaginatively embodied and, moreover, the best
mythology possesses “eternal charm” (Marx), yet mythology is
not formed on the basis of certain conditions of concrete contradictions and, therefore, is not the scientific reflection of reality.
That is to say, in mythology or nursery tales the aspects that
constitute contradiction have no concrete identity but only a
fancied identity. Marxist dialectics scientifically reflects the iden¬
tity in changes of reality.

Why can an egg be transformed into a chicken while a stone
cannot be transformed into a chicken? Why is there identity
between war and peace while there is no identity between war
and a stone? Why can human beings give birth to human beings
but not to anything else? The reason is none other than that
identity of contradiction exists only under certain necessary
conditions. Without certain necessary conditions, there can be
no identity whatever.

Why is it that in Russia the bourgeois-democratic revolution
of March, 1917, was directly linked with the proletarian-socialist
revolution of November of the same year, while in France the
bourgeois revolution was not linked directly with a socialist
revolution, and the Paris Commune of 1871 finally ended in
failure? Why is it, on the other hand, that the nomadic system
in Mongolia and Central Asia has been linked directly with
socialism? Why is it that the Chinese revolution can avoid a
capitalist future and can be directly linked with socialism with¬
out traversing the old historical path of the western countries,
without passing through a period of bourgeois dictatorship?
The reason is none other than the concrete conditions of the
time. When certain necessary conditions are present, then cer¬
tain contradictions arise in the process of development of things
and, what is more, these contradictions and all contradictions
of this kind depend upon each other for existence and transform
themselves into each other; otherwise nothing is possible.

Such is the problem of identity. What then is struggle? What
is the relation between identity and struggle?

Lenin said: “The unity (coincidence, identity, resultant) of
opposites is conditional, temporary, transitory, relative. The
struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as de¬
velopment and motion are absolute.”

What does this passage from Lenin mean?

All processes have a beginning and an end; all processes trans¬
form themselves into their opposites. The stability of all pro¬
cesses is relative, but the mutability manifested in the trans¬
formation of one process into another is absolute.

The movement of all thingse assumes two forms: The form
of relative rest and the form of conspicuous change. Both forms
of the movement are caused by the mutual struggle of the two
contradictory factors contained in a thing itself. When the move¬
ment of a thing assumes the first form, it undergoes only a
quantitative but not a qualitative change, and consequently ap¬
pears in a state of seeming rest. When the movement of a thin g
assumes the second form, it has already reached a certain cul¬
minating point of the quantitative change of the first form,
caused the dissociation of the entity, produced a qualitative
change, and consequently appears in a state of conspicuous
change. Such unity, solidarity, amalgamation, harmony, balance,
stalemate, deadlock, rest, stability, equilibrium, coagulation, at¬
traction, as we see in daily life, are all the appearances of things
in the state of quantitative change. On the other hand, the
dissociation of the entity, the breakdown of such solidarity, amal¬
gamation, harmony, balance, stalemate, deadlock, rest, stability,
equilibrium, coagulation, and attraction, and the change into
their opposite states are all the appearances of things in the
state of qualitative change during the transformation of one
process into another. Things are always transforming themselves
ceaselessly from the first into the second form, while the struggle
within the contradictions exists in both forms and reaches its
solution through the second form. We say, therefore, that the
unity of opposites is conditional, temporary, and relative, while
the struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute.

When we said above that because there is identity between
two opposite things, the two can coexist in an entity and can also
be transformed into each other, we were referring to condition¬
ality. That is to say, under certain conditions contradictory
things can be united and can also be transformed into each
other, but without such conditions, they cannot become con¬
tradictory, cannot coexist, and cannot transform themselves from the one into the other. It is because the identity of con¬
tradiction obtains only under certain conditions that we say
identity is conditional, relative. Here we add: The struggle
within a contradiction runs throughout a process from beginning
to end and causes one process to transform itself into another,
and as the struggle within the contradiction is present every¬
where, we say the struggle within the contradiction is uncon¬
ditional, absolute.

Conditional, relative identity, combined with unconditional,
absolute struggle, constitutes the movement in opposites in all
things.

We Chinese often say: “Things opposed to each other com¬
plement each other.” 38 That is to say, there is identity of op¬
posites. This remark is dialectical, and runs counter to meta¬
physics. To be “opposed to each other” means the mutual exclu¬
sion or struggle of the two contradictory aspects. To “comple¬
ment each other” means that under certain conditions the two
contradictory aspects become united and achieve identity. Strug¬
gle resides precisely in identity; without struggle there can be
no identity.

In identity there is struggle, in particularity there is univer¬
sality, in individual character there is common character. To
quote Lenin, “there is an absolute even within the relative."



VI. The Role of Antagonism in
Contradiction

Among the questions concerning the struggle within the
contradiction, is: What is antagonism? Our answer is: Antagon¬
ism is a form of struggle within the contradiction, but not the
universal form of struggle within the contradiction.

In human history, antagonism between the classes exists as
a particular manifestation of the struggle within the contradic¬
tion, the contradiction between the exploiting class and the
exploited class. The two mutually contradictory classes coexist
for a long time in one society, be it a slave, a feudal, or a
capitalist society, and struggle with each other; but it is not
until the contradiction between the two classes has developed
to a certain stage that the two sides adopt the form of open
antagonism which develops into a revolution. In a class society,
the transformation of peace into war is also like that.

The time when a bomb has not yet exploded is the time when
contradictory things, because of certain conditions, coexist in an
entity. It is not until a new condition (ignition) is present that
the explosion takes place. An analogous situation exists in all
natural phenomena when they finally assume the form of open
antagonism to resolve old contradictions and produce new things.

It is very important to know this situation. It enables us to
understand that in a class society revolutions and revolutionary
wars are inevitable, that apart from them the leap in social
development cannot be made, and the reactionary ruling classes
cannot be overthrown so that the people will win political power.
Communists must expose the deceitful propaganda of the re¬
actionaries that social revolution is unnecessary and impossible,
and so on, and firmly uphold the Marxist-Leninist theory of social revolution, so as to help the people understand that social
revolution is not only entirely necessary but also entirely pos¬
sible, and that the whole history of mankind and the triumph of
the Soviet Union all confirm this scientific truth.

However, we must study concretely the conditions of various
lands of struggle within the contradiction and should not inap¬
propriately impose the above-mentioned formula on everything.
Contradiction and struggle are universal, absolute, but the
methods for resolving contradictions, that is, the forms of strug¬
gle, differ according to the differences in the nature of the
contradictions. Some contradictions are characterized by open
antagonism, some are not. Based on the concrete development
of things, some contradictions, originally non-antagonistic, de¬
velop and become antagonistic, while some contradictions, origin¬
ally antagonistic, develop and become non-antagonistic.

The contradiction between correct ideology and erroneous
ideologies within the Communist Party is, as we said earlier,
the reflection in the party of class contradictions when classes
exist. In the beginning, or with regard to particular matters,
such a contradiction need not immediately manifest itself as
antagonistic. But with the development of the class struggle, it
can also develop and become antagonistic. The history of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union shows us that the con¬
tradiction between the correct ideology of Lenin and Stalin and
the erroneous ideologies of Trotsky, Bukharin, and others, was
in the beginning not yet manifested in an antagonistic form, but
subsequently developed into antagonism. A similar case occurred
in the history of the Chinese Communist Party. The contradic¬
tion between the correct ideology of many of our comrades
in the party and the erroneous ideologies of Chen Tu-hsiu,
Chang Kuo-tao, 40 and others was also in the beginning not man¬
ifested in an antagonistic form, but subsequently developed
into antagonism. At present, the contradiction between the cor¬
rect ideology and the erroneous ideologies in our party is not
manifested in an antagonistic form, and, if comrades who have
made mistakes can correct them, it will not develop into antagon¬
ism. Therefore, on the one hand the party must carry on a serious struggle against erroneous ideologies, and on the other it must
give the comrades who have made mistakes sufficient oppor¬
tunity to become aware of them. Under such conditions, strug¬
gles pushed to excess are obviously not appropriate. But if those
people who have made mistakes persist in them and increase the
gravity of their mistakes, then there is the possibility of such
contradictions developing into antagonism.

Economically, in capitalist society (where the town under
bourgeois rule ruthlessly exploits the countryside) and in the
Kuomintang-ruled areas in China (where the town under the
rule of foreign imperialism and the native, comprador, big bour¬
geoisie most savagely exploits the countryside), the contra¬
diction between the town and the countryside is one of ex¬
treme antagonism. But in a socialist country and in our revolu¬
tionary bases, such an antagonistic contradiction becomes a
non-antagonistic contradiction; and it will disappear when a
communist society is realized.

Lenin said: “Antagonism and contradiction are utterly dif¬
ferent. Under socialism, antagonism disappears, but contradic¬
tion exists.” 41 That is to say, antagonism is only a form of
struggle within the contradiction, but not its universal form; we
cannot impose the formula everywhere.





VII. Conclusion


Having reached this point, we can sum up with a few remarks.

The law of the contradiction in things, that is, the law of
unity of opposites, is the basic law of nature and society, and,
therefore, also the basic law of thought. It is the opposite of
the metaphysical world outlook. It means a great revolution in
the history of human knowledge. According to the viewpoint of
dialectical materialism, contradiction exists in all processes of
objective things and subjective thought and runs through all
processes from beginning to end—this is the universality and
absoluteness of contradiction.

Contradictory things and each of their aspects have respec¬
tively their specific features—this is the particularity and relativ¬
ity of contradiction. Contradictory things, according to certain
conditions, are characterized by identity, and consequently can
coexist in an entity and transform themselves each into its op¬
posite—this again is the particularity and relativity of contradic¬
tion. But the struggle within the contradiction is ceaseless; it
exists at the time when the opposites coexist and likewise when
they are transforming themselves into each other, and the strug¬
gle is especially manifest when they transform themselves into
each other—this again is the universality and absoluteness of
contradiction.

In studying the particularity and relativity of contradiction,
we must note the distinction between what is principal and what
is non-principal in contradictions as well as in contradictory as¬
pects. In studying the universality of, and the struggle within,
the contradiction, we must note the distinction between various
forms of struggle within the contradiction; otherwise we shall
make mistakes.
