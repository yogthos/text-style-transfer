There used to be a number of comrades in our Party who were dogmatists and who for a long period rejected the experience of the Chinese revolution, denying the truth that “Marxism is not a dogma but a guide to action” and over-awing people with words and phrases from Marxist works, torn out of context. There were also a number of comrades who were empiricists and who for a long period restricted themselves to their own fragmentary experience and did not understand the importance of theory for revolutionary prac-tice or see the revolution as a whole, but worked blindly though industriously. The erroneous ideas of these two types of comrades, and particularly of the dogmatists, caused enormous losses to the Chinese revolution during 1931-34, and yet the dogmatists, cloaking themselves as Marxists, confused a great many comrades. “On Practice” was written in order to expose the subjectivist errors of dog-matism and empiricism in the Party, and especially the error of dogmatism, from the standpoint of the Marxist theory of knowledge. It was entitled “On Practice” because its stress was on exposing the dogmatist kind of subjectivism, which belittles practice. The ideas contained in this essay were pre-sented by Mao Tse-tung in a lecture at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political College in Yenan.

Before Marx, materialism examined the problem of knowledge apart from the social na-ture of man and apart from his historical devel-opment, and was therefore incapable of under-standing the dependence of knowledge on social practice, that is, the dependence of knowledge on production and the class struggle.

Above all, Marxists regard man’s activity in production as the most fundamental practical ac-tivity, the determinant of all his other activities. Man’s knowledge depends mainly on his activity in material production, through which he comes gradually to understand the phenomena, the properties and the laws of nature, and the rela-tions between himself and nature; and through his activity in production he also gradually comes to understand, in varying degrees, certain rela-tions that exist between man and man. None of this knowledge can be acquired apart from activ-ity in production. In a classless society every per-son, as a member of society, joins in common ef-fort with the other members, enters into definite relations of production with them and engages in production to meet man’s material needs. In all class societies, the members of the different social classes also enter, in different ways, into definite relations of production and engage in production to meet their material needs. This is the primary source from which human knowledge develops.

Man’s social practice is not confined to activ-ity in production, but takes many other forms — class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic pursuits; in short, as a social being, man participates in all spheres of the practical life of society. Thus man, in varying degrees, comes to know the different relations between man and man, not only through his material life but also through his political and cultural life (both of which are intimately bound up with material life). Of these other types of social practice, class struggle in particular, in all its various forms, exerts a pro-found influence on the development of man’s knowledge. In class society everyone lives as a member of a particular class, and every kind of thinking, without exception, is stamped with the brand of a class.

Marxists hold that in human society activity in production develops step by step from a lower to a higher level and that consequently man’s knowledge, whether of nature or of society, also develops step by step from a lower to a higher level, that is, from the shallower to the deeper,

from the one-sided to the many-sided. For a very long period in history, men were necessarily con-fined to a one-sided understanding of the history of society because, for one thing, the bias of the exploiting classes always distorted history and, for another, the small scale of production limited man’s outlook. It was not until the modern pro-letariat emerged along with immense forces of production (large-scale industry) that man was able to acquire a comprehensive, historical un-derstanding of the development of society and turn this knowledge into a science, the science of Marxism.

Marxists hold that man’s social practice alone is the criterion of the truth of his knowledge of the external world. What actually happens is that man’s knowledge is verified only when he achieves the anticipated results in the process of social practice (material production, class struggle or scientific experiment). If a man wants to succeed in his work, that is, to achieve the anticipated results, he must bring his ideas into correspondence with the laws of the objective external world; if they do not correspond, he will fail in his practice. After he fails, he draws his lessons, corrects his ideas to make them corre-spond to the laws of the external world, and can thus turn failure into success; this is what is meant by “failure is the mother of success” and “a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit.” The dia-lectical materialist theory of knowledge places practice in the primary position, holding that hu-

man knowledge can in no way be separated from practice and repudiating all the erroneous theo-ries which deny the importance of practice or sep-arate knowledge from practice. Thus Lenin said, “Practice is higher than (theoretical) knowledge, for it has not only the dignity of universality, but also of immediate actuality.”1 The Marxist phi-losophy of dialectical materialism has two out-standing characteristics. One is its class nature: it openly avows that dialectical materialism is in the service of the proletariat. The other is its practicality: it emphasizes the dependence of theory on practice, emphasizes that theory is based on practice and in turn serves practice. The truth of any knowledge or theory is determined not by subjective feelings, but by objective results in so-cial practice. Only social practice can be the cri-terion of truth. The standpoint of practice is the primary and basic standpoint in the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge.

But how then does human knowledge arise from practice and in turn serve practice? This will become clear if we look at the process of development of knowledge.

In the process of practice, man at first sees only the phenomenal side, the separate aspects, the external relations of things. For instance, some people from outside come to Yenan on a tour of observation. In the first day or two, they see its topography, streets and houses; they meet many people, attend banquets, evening parties and mass meetings, hear talk of various kinds and read various documents, all these being the phenomena, the separate aspects and the external relations of things. This is called the perceptual stage of cognition, namely, the stage of sense per-ceptions and impressions. That is, these particu-lar things in Yenan act on the sense organs of the members of the observation group, evoke sense perceptions and give rise in their brains to many impressions together with a rough sketch of the external relations among these impressions: this is the first stage of cognition. At this stage, man cannot as yet form concepts, which are deeper, or draw logical conclusions.

As social practice continues, things that give rise to man’s sense perceptions and impressions in the course of his practice are repeated many times; then a sudden change (leap) takes place in the brain in the process of cognition, and con-cepts are formed. Concepts are no longer the phe-nomena, the separate aspects and the external re-lations of things; they grasp the essence, the to-tality and the internal relations of things. Be-tween concepts and sense perceptions there is not only a quantitative but also a qualitative differ-ence. Proceeding further, by means of judgement and inference one is able to draw logical conclusions. The expression in San Kuo Yen Yi,1 “knit the brows and a stratagem comes to mind,” or in San Kuo Yen Yi (Tales of the Three Kingdoms) is a fa-mous Chinese historical novel by Lo Kuan-chung (late 14th and early 15th century). everyday language, “let me think it over,” refers to man’s use of concepts in the brain to form judgements and inferences. This is the second stage of cognition.

When the members of the ob-servation group have collected various data and, what is more, have “thought them over,” they are able to arrive at the judgement that “the Com-munist Party’s policy of the National United Front Against Japan is thorough, sincere and genuine.” Having made this judgement, they can, if they too are genuine about uniting to save the nation, go a step further and draw the following conclusion, “The National United Front Against Japan can succeed.” This stage of conception, judgement and inference is the more important stage in the entire process of knowing a thing; it is the stage of rational knowledge. The real task of knowing is, through perception, to arrive at thought, to arrive step by step at the comprehen-sion of the internal contradictions of objective things, of their laws and of the internal relations between one process and another, that is, to ar-rive at logical knowledge. To repeat, logical knowledge differs from perceptual knowledge in that perceptual knowledge pertains to the separate aspects, the phenomena and the external re-lations of things, whereas logical knowledge takes a big stride forward to reach the totality, the essence and the internal relations of things and discloses the inner contradictions in the sur-rounding world. Therefore, logical knowledge is capable of grasping the development of the sur-rounding world in its totality, in the internal re-lations of all its aspects.

This dialectical materialist theory of the pro-cess of development of knowledge, basing itself on practice and proceeding from the shallower to the deeper, was never worked out by anybody before the rise of Marxism. Marxist materialism solved this problem correctly for the first time, pointing out both materialistically and dialecti-cally the deepening movement of cognition, the movement by which man in society progresses from perceptual knowledge to logical knowledge in his complex, constantly recurring practice of production and class struggle. Lenin said, “The abstraction of matter, of a law of nature, the ab-straction of value, etc., in short, all scientific (cor-rect, serious, not absurd) abstractions reflect nature more deeply, truly and completely.”

Marx-ism-Leninism holds that each of the two stages in the process of cognition has its own characteris-tics, with knowledge manifesting itself as percep-tual at the lower stage and logical at the higher stage, but that both are stages in an integrated process of cognition. The perceptual and the ra-tional are qualitatively different, but are not divorced from each other; they are unified on the basis of practice. Our practice proves that what is perceived cannot at once be comprehended and that only what is comprehended can be more deeply perceived. Perception only solves the problem of phenomena; theory alone can solve the problem of essence. The solving of both these problems is not separable in the slightest degree from practice.

Whoever wants to know a thing has no way of doing so except by coming into contact with it, that is, by living (practising) in its environment. In feudal society it was impossible to know the laws of capitalist society in advance because capitalism had not yet emerged, the rele-vant practice was lacking. Marxism could be the product only of capitalist society. Marx, in the era of laissez-faire capitalism, could not con-cretely know certain laws peculiar to the era of imperialism beforehand, because imperialism, the last stage of capitalism, had not yet emerged and the relevant practice was lacking; only Lenin and Stalin could undertake this task.

Leaving aside their genius, the reason why Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin could work out their theories was mainly that they personally took part in the practice of the class struggle and the scientific ex-perimentation of their time; lacking this condi-tion, no genius could have succeeded. The saying, “without stepping outside his gate the scholar knows all the wide world’s affairs,” was mere empty talk in past times when technology was undeveloped. Even though this saying can be valid in the present age of developed technology, the people with real personal knowledge are those engaged in practice the wide world over. And it is only when these people have come to “know” through their practice and when their knowledge has reached him through writing and technical media that the “scholar” can indirectly “know all the wide world’s affairs.”

If you want to know a certain thing or a certain class of things directly, you must personally participate in the practical struggle to change reality, to change that thing or class of things, for only thus can you come into contact with them as phenomena; only through personal participation in the practical struggle to change reality can you uncover the es-sence of that thing or class of things and compre-hend them. This is the path to knowledge which every man actually travels, though some people, deliberately distorting matters, argue to the con-trary. The most ridiculous person in the world is the “know-all” who picks up a smattering of hearsay knowledge and proclaims himself “the world’s Number One authority”; this merely shows that he has not taken a proper measure of himself. Knowledge is a matter of science, and no dishonesty or conceit whatsoever is permissible. What is required is definitely the reverse — hon-esty and modesty. If you want knowledge, you must take part in the practice of changing reality.

If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eating it yourself. If you want to know the structure and properties of the atom, you must make physical and chemical experi-ments to change the state of the atom. If you want to know the theory and methods of revolu-tion, you must take part in revolution. All genu-ine knowledge originates in direct experience. But one cannot have direct experience of every-thing; as a matter of fact, most of our knowledge comes from indirect experience, for example, all knowledge from past times and foreign lands. To our ancestors and to foreigners, such knowledge was — or is — a matter of direct experience, and this knowledge is reliable if in the course of their direct experience the requirement of “scientific abstraction,” spoken of by Lenin, was — or is — fulfilled and objective reality scientifically re-flected, otherwise it is not reliable.

Hence a man’s knowledge consists only of two parts, that which comes from direct experience and that which comes from indirect experience. Moreover, what is indirect experience for me is direct experience for other people. Consequently, considered as a whole, knowledge of any kind is inseparable from direct experience. All knowledge originates in perception of the objective external world through man’s physical sense organs. Anyone who denies such perception, denies direct experi-ence, or denies personal participation in the prac-tice that changes reality, is not a materialist. That is why the “know-all” is ridiculous. There is an old Chinese saying, “How can you catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger’s lair?” This say-ing holds true for man’s practice and it also holds true for the theory of knowledge. There can be no knowledge apart from practice.

To make clear the dialectical materialist movement of cognition arising on the basis of the practice which changes reality — to make clear the gradually deepening movement of cognition — a few additional concrete examples are given below.

In its knowledge of capitalist society, the pro-letariat was only in the perceptual stage of cognition in the first period of its practice, the period of machine-smashing and spontaneous struggle; it knew only some of the aspects and the external relations of the phenomena of capitalism. The proletariat was then still a “class-in-itself.” But when it reached the second period of its practice, the period of conscious and organized economic and political struggles, the proletariat was able to comprehend the essence of capitalist society, the relations of exploitation between social classes and its own historical task; and it was able to do so because of its own practice and because of its experience of prolonged struggle, which Marx and Engels scientifically summed up in all its va-riety to create the theory of Marxism for the ed-ucation of the proletariat. It was then that the proletariat became a “class-for-itself.”

Similarly with the Chinese people’s knowledge of imperialism. The first stage was one of superficial, perceptual knowledge, as shown in the indiscriminate anti-foreign strug-gles of the Movement of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Yi Ho Tuan Movement, and so on. It was only in the second stage that the Chi-nese people reached the stage of rational knowledge, saw the internal and external contra-dictions of imperialism and saw the essential truth that imperialism had allied itself with China’s comprador and feudal classes to oppress and exploit the great masses of the Chinese peo-ple. This knowledge began about the time of the May 4th Movement of 1919.

Next, let us consider war. If those who lead a war lack experience of war, then at the initial stage they will not understand the profound laws pertaining to the directing of a specific war (such as our Agrarian Revolutionary War of the past decade). At the initial stage they will merely ex-perience a good deal of fighting and, what is more, suffer many defeats. But this experience (the experience of battles won and especially of battles lost) enables them to comprehend the inner thread of the whole war, namely, the laws of that specific war, to understand its strategy and tactics, and consequently to direct the war with confidence. If, at such a moment, the command is turned over to an inexperienced person, then he too will have to suffer a number of defeats (gain experience) before he can comprehend the true laws of the war.

“I am not sure I can handle it.” We often hear this remark when a comrade hesitates to accept an assignment. Why is he unsure of himself? Be-cause he has no systematic understanding of the content and circumstances of the assignment, or because he has had little or no contact with such work, and so the laws governing it are beyond him. After a detailed analysis of the nature and circumstances of the assignment, he will feel more sure of himself and do it willingly. If he spends some time at the job and gains experience and if he is a person who is willing to look into matters with an open mind and not one who ap-proaches problems subjectively, one-sidedly and superficially, then he can draw conclusions for himself as to how to go about the job and do it with much more courage. Only those who are subjective, one-sided and superficial in their ap-proach to problems will smugly issue orders or directives the moment they arrive on the scene, without considering the circumstances, without viewing things in their totality (their history and their present state as a whole) and without get-ting to the essence of things (their nature and the internal relations between one thing and an-other). Such people are bound to trip and fall.

Thus it can be seen that the first step in the process of cognition is contact with the objects of the external world; this belongs to the stage of perception. The second step is to synthesize the data of perception by arranging and reconstruct-ing them; this belongs to the stage of conception, judgement and inference. It is only when the data of perception are very rich (not fragmentary) and correspond to reality (are not illusory) that they can be the basis for forming correct concepts and theories.

Here two important points must be empha-sized. The first, which has been stated before but should be repeated here, is the dependence of ra-tional knowledge upon perceptual knowledge. Anyone who thinks that rational knowledge need not be derived from perceptual knowledge is an idealist. In the history of philosophy there is the “rationalist” school that admits the reality only of reason and not of experience, believing that reason alone is reliable while perceptual experi-ence is not; this school errs by turning things up-side down. The rational is reliable precisely be-cause it has its source in sense perceptions, other-wise it would be like water without a source, a tree without roots, subjective, self-engendered and unreliable. As to the sequence in the process of cognition, perceptual experience comes first; we stress the significance of social practice in the process of cognition precisely because social practice alone can give rise to human knowledge and it alone can start man on the acquisition of perceptual experience from the objective world. For a person who shuts his eyes, stops his ears and totally cuts himself off from the objective world there can be no such thing as knowledge. Knowledge begins with experience — this is the materialism of the theory of knowledge.

The second point is that knowledge needs to be deepened, that the perceptual stage of knowledge needs to be developed to the rational stage — this is the dialectics of the theory of knowledge.

“In order to understand, it is necessary empirically to begin understanding, study, to rise from empiricism to the the lower, perceptual stage and that perceptual knowledge alone is reliable while rational knowledge is not, would be to repeat the histori-cal error of “empiricism.” This theory errs in fail-ing to understand that, although the data of per-ception reflect certain realities in the objective world (I am not speaking here of idealist empiri-cism which confines experience to so-called intro-spection), they are merely one-sided and superfi-cial, reflecting things incompletely and not re-flecting their essence. Fully to reflect a thing in its totality, to reflect its essence, to reflect its inher-ent laws, it is necessary through the exercise of thought to reconstruct the rich data of sense per-ception, discarding the dross and selecting the es-sential, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding from the one to the other and from the outside to the inside, in order to form a system of concepts and theories — it is necessary to make a leap from perceptual to rational knowledge. Such reconstructed knowledge is not more empty or more unreliable; on the contrary, whatever has been scientifically reconstructed in the process of cognition, on the basis of practice, reflects objective reality, as Lenin said, more deeply, more truly, more fully. As against this, vulgar “practical men” respect experience but despise theory, and therefore cannot have a com-prehensive view of an entire objective process, universal.” (V.I. Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Mos-cow, 1958, Vol. 38, p. 197.) lack clear direction and long-range perspective, and are complacent over occasional successes and glimpses of the truth. If such persons direct a revolution, they will lead it up a blind alley.

Rational knowledge depends upon percep-tual knowledge and perceptual knowledge remains to be developed into rational knowledge — this is the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge. In philosophy, neither “rationalism” nor “empiricism” understands the historical or the dialectical nature of knowledge, and alt-hough each of these schools contains one aspect of the truth (here I am referring to materialist, not to idealist, rationalism and empiricism), both are wrong on the theory of knowledge as a whole. The dialectical materialist movement of knowledge from the perceptual to the rational holds true for a minor process of cognition (for instance, knowing a single thing or task) as well as for a major process of cognition (for instance, knowing a whole society or a revolution).

But the movement of knowledge does not end here. If the dialectical materialist movement of knowledge were to stop at rational knowledge, only half the problem would be dealt with. And as far as Marxist philosophy is concerned, only the less important half at that. Marxist philoso-phy holds that the most important problem does not lie in understanding the laws of the objective world and thus being able to explain it, but in ap-plying the knowledge of these laws actively to change the world. From the Marxist viewpoint, theory is important, and its importance is fully expressed in Lenin’s statement, “Without revolu-tionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement.”1 But Marxism emphasizes the im-portance of theory precisely and only because it can guide action. If we have a correct theory but merely prate about it, pigeonhole it and do not put it into practice, then that theory, however good, is of no significance. Knowledge begins with practice, and theoretical knowledge is ac-quired through practice and must then return to practice. The active function of knowledge man-ifests itself not only in the active leap from per-ceptual to rational knowledge, but — and this is more important — it must manifest itself in the leap from rational knowledge to revolutionary practice. The knowledge which grasps the laws of the world, must be redirected to the practice of changing the world, must be applied anew in the practice of production, in the practice of revolu-tionary class struggle and revolutionary national struggle and in the practice of scientific experi-ment.

This is the process of testing and develop-ing theory, the continuation of the whole process of cognition. The problem of whether theory cor-responds to objective reality is not, and cannot be, completely solved in the movement of knowledge from the perceptual to the rational, mentioned above. The only way to solve this problem completely is to redirect rational knowledge to social practice, apply theory to practice and see whether it can achieve the objec-tives one has in mind. Many theories of natural science are held to be true not only because they were so considered when natural scientists originated them, but because they have been verified in subsequent scientific practice. Similarly, Marxism-Leninism is held to be true not only be-cause it was so considered when it was scientifi-cally formulated by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Sta-lin but because it has been verified in the subse-quent practice of revolutionary class struggle and revolutionary national struggle. Dialectical ma-terialism is universally true because it is impossible for anyone to escape from its domain in his practice. The history of human knowledge tells us that the truth of many theories is incomplete and that this incompleteness is remedied through the test of practice. Many theories are erroneous and it is through the test of practice that their er-rors are corrected. That is why practice is the cri-terion of truth and why “the standpoint of life, of practice, should be first and fundamental in the theory of knowledge.”1 Stalin has well said, “Theory becomes purposeless if it is not con-nected with revolutionary practice, just as prac-tice gropes in the dark if its path is not illumined by revolutionary theory.”

When we get to this point, is the movement of knowledge completed? Our answer is: it is and yet it is not. When men in society throw them-selves into the practice of changing a certain ob-jective process (whether natural or social) at a certain stage of its development, they can, as a result of the reflection of the objective process in their brains and the exercise of their subjective activity, advance their knowledge from the per-ceptual to the rational, and create ideas, theories, plans or programs which correspond in general to the laws of that objective process. They then apply these ideas, theories, plans or programs in practice in the same objective process. And if they can realize the aims they have in mind, that is, if in that same process of practice they can translate, or on the whole translate, those previ-ously formulated ideas, theories, plans or pro-grams into fact, then the movement of knowledge may be considered completed with regard to this particular process. In the process of changing na-ture, take for example the fulfilment of an engi-neering plan, the verification of a scientific hy-pothesis, the manufacture of an implement or the reaping of a crop; or in the process of changing society, take for example the victory of a strike, victory in a war or the fulfilment of an educa-tional plan. All these may be considered the realization of aims one has in mind. But generally speaking, whether in the practice of changing na-ture or of changing society, men’s original ideas, theories, plans or programs are seldom realized without any alteration.

This is because people engaged in changing reality are usually subject to numerous limita-tions; they are limited not only by existing scien-tific and technological conditions but also by the development of the objective process itself and the degree to which this process has become man-ifest (the aspects and the essence of the objective process have not yet been fully revealed). In such a situation, ideas, theories, plans or programs are usually altered partially and sometimes even wholly, because of the discovery of unforeseen circumstances in the course of practice. That is to say, it does happen that the original ideas, theo-ries, plans or programs fail to correspond with reality either in whole or in part and are wholly or partially incorrect. In many instances, failures have to be repeated many times before errors in knowledge can be corrected and correspondence with the laws of the objective process achieved, and consequently before the subjective can be transformed into the objective, or in other words, before the anticipated results can be achieved in practice. But when that point is reached, no mat-ter how, the movement of human knowledge re-garding a certain objective process at a certain stage of its development may be considered com-pleted.

However, so far as the progression of the pro-cess is concerned, the movement of human knowledge is not completed. Every process, whether in the realm of nature or of society, pro-gresses and develops by reason of its internal contradiction and struggle, and the movement of human knowledge should also progress and de-velop along with it. As far as social movements are concerned, true revolutionary leaders must not only be good at correcting their ideas, theo-ries, plans or programs when errors are discov-ered, as has been indicated above; but when a cer-tain objective process has already progressed and changed from one stage of development to an-other, they must also be good at making them-selves and all their fellow-revolutionaries progress and change in their subjective knowledge along with it, that is to say, they must ensure that the proposed new revolutionary tasks and new working programs correspond to the new changes in the situation. In a revolutionary pe-riod the situation changes very rapidly; if the knowledge of revolutionaries does not change rapidly in accordance with the changed situation, they will be unable to lead the revolution to victory.

It often happens, however, that thinking lags behind reality; this is because man’s cognition is limited by numerous social conditions. We are opposed to die-hards in the revolutionary ranks whose thinking fails to advance with changing objective circumstances and has manifested itself historically as Right opportunism. These people fail to see that the struggle of opposites has al-ready pushed the objective process forward while their knowledge has stopped at the old stage. This is characteristic of the thinking of all die-hards. Their thinking is divorced from social practice, and they cannot march ahead to guide the chariot of society; they simply trail behind, grumbling that it goes too fast and trying to drag it back or turn it in the opposite direction.

We are also opposed to “Left” phrasemon-gering. The thinking of “Leftists” outstrips a given stage of development of the objective pro-cess; some regard their fantasies as truth, while others strain to realize in the present an ideal which can only be realized in the future. They alienate themselves from the current practice of the majority of the people and from the realities of the day, and show themselves adventurist in their actions.

Idealism and mechanical materialism, oppor-tunism and adventurism, are all characterized by the breach between the subjective and the objec-tive, by the separation of knowledge from prac-tice. The Marxist-Leninist theory of knowledge, characterized as it is by scientific social practice, cannot but resolutely oppose these wrong ideolo-gies. Marxists recognize that in the absolute and general process of development of the universe, the development of each particular process is rel-ative, and that hence, in the endless flow of abso-lute truth, man’s knowledge of a particular pro-cess at any given stage of development is only rel-ative truth. The sum total of innumerable relative truths constitutes absolute truth.1 The develop-ment of an objective process is full of contradic-tions and struggles, and so is the development of the movement of human knowledge. All the dialectical movements of the objective world can sooner or later be reflected in human knowledge. In social practice, the process of coming into be-ing, developing and passing away is infinite, and so is the process of coming into being, developing and passing away in human knowledge. As man’s practice which changes objective reality in ac-cordance with given ideas, theories, plans or pro-grams, advances further and further, his knowledge of objective reality likewise becomes deeper and deeper. The movement of change in the world of objective reality is never-ending and so is man’s cognition of truth through practice. Marxism-Leninism has in no way exhausted truth but ceaselessly opens up roads to the knowledge of truth in the course of practice. Our conclusion is the concrete, historical unity of the subjective and the objective, of theory and prac-tice, of knowing and doing, and we are opposed to all erroneous ideologies, whether “Left” or Right, which depart from concrete history.

In the present epoch of the development of society, the responsibility of correctly knowing and changing the world has been placed by his-tory upon the shoulders of the proletariat and its party. This process, the practice of changing the world, which is determined in accordance with scientific knowledge, has already reached an his-toric moment in the world and in China, a great moment unprecedented in human history, that is, the moment for completely banishing darkness from the world and from China, and for chang-ing the world into a world of light such as never previously existed. The struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people to change the world comprises the fulfilment of the following tasks: to change the objective world and, at the same time, their own subjective world — to change their cognitive ability and change the relations between the subjective and the objective world. Such a change has already come about in one part of the globe, in the Soviet Union. There the people are pushing forward this process of change. The people of China and the rest of the world either are going through, or will go through, such a process. And the objective world which is to be changed also includes all the oppo-nents of change, who, in order to be changed, must go through a stage of compulsion before they can enter the stage of voluntary, conscious change. The epoch of world communism will be reached when all mankind voluntarily and con-sciously changes itself and the world.

Discover the truth through practice, and again through practice verify and develop the truth. Start from perceptual knowledge and ac-tively develop it into rational knowledge; then start from rational knowledge and actively guide revolutionary practice to change both the subjec-tive and the objective world. Practice, knowledge, again practice, and again knowledge.

This form repeats itself in endless cycles, and with each cycle the content of practice and knowledge rises to a higher level. Such is the whole of the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge, and such is the dialectical materialist theory of the unity of knowing and doing.

This essay on philosophy was written by Mao Tse-tung after his essay “On Practice” and with the same object of overcoming the serious error of dogmatist thinking to be found in the Party at the time. Originally delivered as lec-tures at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political College in Yenan, it was revised by the author on its inclusion in his Selected Works.

The law of contradiction in things, that is, the law of the unity of opposites, is the basic law of materialist dialectics. Lenin said, “Dialectics in the proper sense is the study of contradiction in the very essence of objects.”1 Lenin often called this law the essence of dialectics; he also called it the kernel of dialectics.2 In studying this law, therefore, we cannot but touch upon a variety of questions, upon a number of philosophical prob-lems. If we can become clear on all these prob-lems, we shall arrive at a fundamental under-standing of materialist dialectics. The problems are: the two world outlooks, the universality of contradiction, the particularity of contradiction, the principal contradiction and the principal as-pect of a contradiction, the identity and struggle of the aspects of a contradiction, and the place of antagonism in contradiction.

The criticism to which the idealism of the De-borin school has been subjected in Soviet philosophical circles in recent years has aroused great interest among us. Deborin’s idealism has ex-erted a very bad influence in the Chinese Com-munist Party, and it cannot be said that the dog-matist thinking in our Party is unrelated to the approach of that school. Our present study of philosophy should therefore have the eradication of dogmatist thinking as its main objective.

Throughout the history of human knowledge, there have been two conceptions concerning the law of development of the universe, the metaphysical conception and the dia-lectical conception, which form two opposing world outlooks. Lenin said:

The two basic (or two possible? or two his-torically observable?) conceptions of develop-ment (evolution) are: development as decrease and increase, as repetition, and development as a unity of opposites (the division of a unity into mutually exclusive opposites and their reciprocal relation).

Here Lenin was referring to these two different world outlooks.

In China another name for metaphysics is hsuan-hsueh. For a long period in history whether in China or in Europe, this way of thinking, which is part and parcel of the idealist world out-look, occupied a dominant position in human thought. In Europe, the materialism of the bour-geoisie in its early days was also metaphysical. As the social economy of many European countries advanced to the stage of highly developed capi-talism, as the forces of production, the class struggle and the sciences developed to a level un-precedented in history, and as the industrial proletariat became the greatest motive force in his-torical development, there arose the Marxist world outlook of materialist dialectics. Then, in addition to open and barefaced reactionary ide-alism, vulgar evolutionism emerged among the bourgeoisie to oppose materialist dialectics.

The metaphysical or vulgar evolutionist world outlook sees things as isolated, static and one-sided. It regards all things in the universe, their forms and their species, as eternally isolated from one another and immutable. Such change as there is can only be an increase or decrease in quantity or a change of place. Moreover, the cause of such an increase or decrease or change of place is not inside things but outside them, that is, the motive force is external. Metaphysicians hold that all the different kinds of things in the universe and all their characteristics have been the same ever since they first came into being. All subsequent changes have simply been increases or decreases in quantity. They contend that a thing can only keep on repeating itself as the same kind of thing and cannot change into any-thing different. In their opinion, capitalist exploi-tation, capitalist competition, the individualist ideology of capitalist society, and so on, can all be found in ancient slave society, or even in prim-itive society, and will exist forever unchanged. They ascribe the causes of social development to factors external to society, such as geography and climate.

They search in an over-simplified way outside a thing for the causes of its develop-ment, and they deny the theory of materialist di-alectics which holds that development arises from the contradictions inside a thing. Conse-quently they can explain neither the qualitative diversity of things, nor the phenomenon of one quality changing into another. In Europe, this mode of thinking existed as mechanical material-ism in the 17th and 18th centuries and as vulgar evolutionism at the end of the 19th and the be-ginning of the 20th centuries. In China, there was the metaphysical thinking exemplified in the say-ing “Heaven changeth not, likewise the Tao changeth not,”and it was supported by the decadent feudal ruling classes for a long time. Me-chanical materialism and vulgar evolutionism, which were imported from Europe in the last hundred years, are supported by the bourgeoisie.

As opposed to the metaphysical world out-look, the world outlook of materialist dialectics holds that in order to understand the develop-ment of a thing we should study it internally and in its relations with other things; in other words, the development of things should be seen as their internal and necessary self-movement, while each thing in its movement is interrelated with and in-teracts on the things around it. The fundamental cause of the development of a thing is not external but internal; it lies in the contradictoriness within the thing. There is internal contradiction a well-known exponent of Confucianism in the Han Dynasty. in every single thing, hence its motion and devel-opment. Contradictoriness within a thing is the fundamental cause of its development, while its interrelations and interactions with other things are secondary causes. Thus materialist dialectics effectively combats the theory of external causes, or of an external motive force, advanced by met-aphysical mechanical materialism and vulgar evolutionism. It is evident that purely external causes can only give rise to mechanical motion, that is, to changes in scale or quantity, but cannot explain why things differ qualitatively in thou-sands of ways and why one thing changes into another. As a matter of fact, even mechanical motion under external force occurs through the internal contradictoriness of things. Simple growth in plants and animals, their quantitative development, is likewise chiefly the result of their internal contradictions. Similarly, social develop-ment is due chiefly not to external but to internal causes. Countries with almost the same geo-graphical and climatic conditions display great diversity and unevenness in their development.

Moreover, great social changes may take place in one and the same country although its geography and climate remain unchanged. Imperialist Rus-sia changed into the socialist Soviet Union, and feudal Japan, which had locked its doors against the world, changed into imperialist Japan, alt-hough no change occurred in the geography and climate of either country. Long dominated by feudalism, China has undergone great changes in the last hundred years and is now changing in the direction of a new China, liberated and free, and yet no change has occurred in her geography and climate. Changes do take place in the geography and climate of the earth as a whole and in every part of it, but they are insignificant when compared with changes in society; geographical and climatic changes manifest themselves in terms of tens of thousands of years, while social changes manifest themselves in thousands, hundreds or tens of years, and even in a few years or months in times of revolution. According to materialist dialectics, changes in nature are due chiefly to the development of the internal contradictions in na-ture.

Changes in society are due chiefly to the de-velopment of the internal contradictions in society, that is, the contradiction between the pro-ductive forces and the relations of production, the contradiction between classes and the contra-diction between the old and the new; it is the de-velopment of these contradictions that pushes so-ciety forward and gives the impetus for the super-session of the old society by the new. Does mate-rialist dialectics exclude external causes? Not at all. It holds that external causes are the condition of change and internal causes are the basis of change, and that external causes become opera-tive through internal causes. In a suitable temper-ature an egg changes into a chicken, but no tem-perature can change a stone into a chicken, be-cause each has a different basis. There is constant interaction between the peoples of different countries. In the era of capitalism, and especially in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolu-tion, the interaction and mutual impact of differ-ent countries in the political, economic and cul-tural spheres are extremely great. The October Socialist Revolution ushered in a new epoch in world history as well as in Russian history.

It exerted influence on internal changes in the other countries in the world and, similarly and in a particularly profound way, on internal changes in China. These changes, however, were effected through the inner laws of development of these countries, China included. In battle, one army is victorious and the other is defeated; both the vic-tory and the defeat are determined by internal causes. The one is victorious either because it is strong or because of its competent generalship, the other is vanquished either because it is weak or because of its incompetent generalship; it is through internal causes that external causes be-come operative. In China in 1927, the defeat of the proletariat by the big bourgeoisie came about through the opportunism then to be found within the Chinese proletariat itself (inside the Chinese Communist Party). When we liquidated this opportunism, the Chinese revolution resumed its advance. Later, the Chinese revolution again suf-fered severe setbacks at the hands of the enemy, because adventurism had risen within our Party. When we liquidated this adventurism, our cause advanced once again. Thus it can be seen that to lead the revolution to victory, a political party must depend on the correctness of its own politi-cal line and the solidity of its own organization.

The dialectical world outlook emerged in an-cient times both in China and in Europe. Ancient dialectics, however, had a somewhat spontane-ous and naive character; in the social and historical conditions then prevailing, it was not yet able to form a theoretical system, hence it could not fully explain the world and was supplanted by metaphysics. The famous German philosopher Hegel, who lived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, made most important contributions to dialectics, but his dialectics was idealist. It was not until Marx and Engels, the great protagonists of the proletarian movement, had synthesized the positive achievements in the history of human knowledge and, in particular, critically absorbed the rational elements of Hegelian dialectics and created the great theory of dialectical and histor-ical materialism that an unprecedented revolu-tion occurred in the history of human knowledge. This theory was further developed by Lenin and Stalin. As soon as it spread to China, it wrought tremendous changes in the world of Chinese thought.

This dialectical world outlook teaches us pri-marily how to observe and analyse the movement of opposites in different things and, on the basis of such analysis, to indicate the methods for re-solving contradictions. It is therefore most im-portant for us to understand the law of contra-diction in things in a concrete way.

For convenience of exposition, I shall deal first with the universality of contradiction and then proceed to the particularity of contradic-tion. The reason is that the universality of con-tradiction can be explained more briefly, for it has been widely recognized ever since the materi-alist-dialectical world outlook was discovered and materialist dialectics applied with outstand-ing success to analysing many aspects of human history and natural history and to changing many aspects of society and nature (as in the So-viet Union) by the great creators and continuers of Marxism — Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin; whereas the particularity of contradiction is still not clearly understood by many comrades, and especially by the dogmatists. They do not under-stand that it is precisely in the particularity of contradiction that the universality of contradic-tion resides. Nor do they understand how im-portant is the study of the particularity of contra-diction in the concrete things confronting us for guiding the course of revolutionary practice. Therefore, it is necessary to stress the study of the particularity of contradiction and to explain it at adequate length. For this reason, in our analysis of the law of contradiction in things, we shall first analyse the universality of contradiction, then place special stress on analysing the particularity of contradiction, and finally return to the univer-sality of contradiction.

The universality or absoluteness of contra-diction has a twofold meaning. One is that con-tradiction exists in the process of development of all things, and the other is that in the process of development of each thing a movement of oppo-sites exists from beginning to end.

Engels said, “Motion itself is a contradiction.”Lenin defined the law of the unity of op-posites as “the recognition (discovery) of the con-tradictory, mutually exclusive, opposite tenden-cies in all phenomena and processes of nature (including mind and society).”Are these ideas cor-rect? Yes, they are. The interdependence of the contradictory aspects present in all things and the struggle between these aspects determine the life of all things and push their development forward. There is nothing that does not contain contradic-tion; without contradiction nothing would exist.

Contradiction is the basis of the simple forms of motion (for instance, mechanical motion) and still more so of the complex forms of motion.

Engels explained the universality of contradiction as follows:

“If simple mechanical change of place contains a contradiction, this is even more true of the higher forms of motion of matter, and especially of organic life and its development... life consists precisely and primarily in this — that a being is at each moment itself and yet something else. Life is therefore also a contradiction which is present in things and processes themselves, and which constantly originates and resolves itself; and as soon as the contradiction ceases, life, too, comes to an end, and death steps in. We likewise saw that also in the sphere of thought we could not escape contradictions, and that for example the contradiction between man’s inherently unlimited capacity for knowledge and its actual presence only in men who are externally limited and possess limited cognition finds its solution in what is — at least practically, for us — an endless succession of generations, in infinite progress.

“...one of the basic principles of higher mathematics is the contradiction that in certain circumstances straight lines and curves may be the same.... “But even lower mathematics teems with contradictions.”

Lenin illustrated the universality of contra-diction as follows:

“In mechanics: action and reaction. “In physics: positive and negative electricity. “In chemistry: the combination and dissociation of atoms. “In social science: the class struggle.”1

In war, offence and defence, advance and re-treat, victory and defeat are all mutually contra-dictory phenomena. One cannot exist without the other. The two aspects are at once in conflict and in interdependence, and this constitutes the totality of a war, pushes its development forward and solves its problems.

Every difference in men’s concepts should be regarded as reflecting an objective contradiction.

Objective contradictions are reflected in subjec-tive thinking, and this process constitutes the contradictory movement of concepts, pushes for-ward the development of thought, and cease-lessly solves problems in man’s thinking.

Opposition and struggle between ideas of dif-ferent kinds constantly occur within the Party; this is a reflection within the Party of contradic-tions between classes and between the new and the old in society. If there were no contradictions in the Party and no ideological struggles to re-solve them, the Party’s life would come to an end.

Thus it is already clear that contradiction exists universally and in all processes, whether in the simple or in the complex forms of motion, whether in objective phenomena or ideological phenomena. But does contradiction also exist at the initial stage of each process? Is there a movement of opposites from beginning to end in the process of development of every single thing?

As can be seen from the articles written by Soviet philosophers criticizing it, the Deborin school maintains that contradiction appears not at the inception of a process but only when it has developed to a certain stage. If this were the case, then the cause of the development of the process before that stage would be external and not inter-nal. Deborin thus reverts to the metaphysical theories of external causality and of mechanism. Ap-plying this view in the analysis of concrete prob-lems, the Deborin school sees only differences but no contradictions between the kulaks and the peasants in general under existing conditions in the Soviet Union, thus entirely agreeing with Bu-kharin. In analysing the French Revolution, it holds that before the Revolution there were like-wise only differences but not contradictions within the Third Estate, which was composed of the workers, the peasants and the bourgeoisie.

These views of the Deborin school are anti-Marxist. This school does not understand that each and every difference already contains con-tradiction and that difference itself is contradic-tion. Labour and capital have been in contradic-tion ever since the two classes came into being, only at first the contradiction had not yet become intense. Even under the social conditions existing in the Soviet Union, there is a difference between workers and peasants and this very difference is a contradiction, although, unlike the contradiction between labour and capital, it will not be-come intensified into antagonism or assume the form of class struggle; the workers and the peas-ants have established a firm alliance in the course of socialist construction and are gradually resolv-ing this contradiction in the course of the ad-vance from socialism to communism. The ques-tion is one of different kinds of contradiction, not of the presence or absence of contradiction. Con-tradiction is universal and absolute, it is present in the process of development of all things and permeates every process from beginning to end.

What is meant by the emergence of a new process? The old unity with its constituent oppo-sites yields to a new unity with its constituent op-posites, whereupon a new process emerges to re-place the old. The old process ends and the new one begins. The new process contains new con-tradictions and begins its own history of the development of contradictions.

As Lenin pointed out, Marx in his Capital gave a model analysis of this movement of oppo-sites which runs through the process of develop-ment of things from beginning to end. This is the method that must be employed in studying the development of all things. Lenin, too, employed this method correctly and adhered to it in all his writings.

In his Capital, Marx first analyses the sim-plest, most ordinary and fundamental, most common and everyday relation of bourgeois (commodity) society, a relation encountered bil-lions of times, viz. the exchange of commodities. In this very simple phenomenon (in this “cell” of bourgeois society) analysis reveals all the contra-dictions (or the germs of all the contradictions) of modern society. The subsequent exposition

shows us the development (both growth and movement) of these contradictions and of this so-ciety in the X [summation] of its individual parts, from its beginning to its end. Lenin added, “Such must also be the method of exposition (or study) of dialectics in general.”

Chinese Communists must learn this method; only then will they be able correctly to analyse the history and the present state of the Chinese revolution and infer its future.

Contradiction is present in the process of de-velopment of all things; it permeates the process of development of each thing from beginning to end. This is the universality and absoluteness of contradiction which we have discussed above. Now let us discuss the particularity and relativity of contradiction. This problem should be studied on several levels.

First, the contradiction in each form of mo-tion of matter has its particularity. Man’s knowledge of matter is knowledge of its forms of motion, because there is nothing in this world ex-cept matter in motion and this motion must as-sume certain forms. In considering each form of motion of matter, we must observe the points which it has in common with other forms of mo-tion. But what is especially important and neces-sary, constituting as it does the foundation of our knowledge of a thing, is to observe what is par-ticular to this form of motion of matter, namely, to observe the qualitative difference between this form of motion and other forms. Only when we have done so can we distinguish between things. Every form of motion contains within itself its own particular contradiction. This particular contradiction constitutes the particular essence which distinguishes one thing from another. It is the internal cause or, as it may be called, the basis for the immense variety of things in the world. There are many forms of motion in nature, me-chanical motion, sound, light, heat, electricity, dissociation, combination, and so on. All these forms are interdependent, but in its essence each is different from the others. The particular es-sence of each form of motion is determined by its own particular contradiction. This holds true not only for nature but also for social and ideological phenomena. Every form of society, every form of ideology, has its own particular contradiction and particular essence.

The sciences are differentiated precisely on the basis of the particular contradictions inherent in their respective objects of study. Thus the contradiction peculiar to a certain field of phenom-ena constitutes the object of study for a specific branch of science. For example, positive and neg-ative numbers in mathematics; action and reac-tion in mechanics; positive and negative electric-ity in physics; dissociation and combination in chemistry; forces of production and relations of production, classes and class struggle, in social science; offence and defence in military science; idealism and materialism, the metaphysical out-look and the dialectical outlook, in philosophy; and so on — all these are the objects of study of different branches of science precisely because each branch has its own particular contradiction and particular essence. Of course, unless we un-derstand the universality of contradiction, we have no way of discovering the universal cause or universal basis for the movement or development of things; however, unless we study the particu-larity of contradiction, we have no way of deter-mining the particular essence of a thing which differentiates it from other things, no way of discovering the particular cause or particular basis for the movement or development of a thing, and no way of distinguishing one thing from another or of demarcating the fields of science.

As regards the sequence in the movement of man’s knowledge, there is always a gradual growth from the knowledge of individual and particular things to the knowledge of things in general. Only after man knows the particular es-sence of many different things can he proceed to generalization and know the common essence of things. When man attains the knowledge of this common essence, he uses it as a guide and pro-ceeds to study various concrete things which have not yet been studied, or studied thoroughly, and to discover the particular essence of each; only thus is he able to supplement, enrich and develop his knowledge of their common essence and pre-vent such knowledge from withering or petrifying.

These are the two processes of cognition: one, from the particular to the general, and the other, from the general to the particular. Thus cognition always moves in cycles and (so long as scientific method is strictly adhered to) each cycle advances human knowledge a step higher and so makes it more and more profound. Where our dogmatists err on this question is that, on the one hand, they do not understand that we have to study the particularity of contradiction and know the particular essence of individual things before we can adequately know the universality of contradiction and the common essence of things, and that, on the other hand, they do not understand that after knowing the common es-sence of things, we must go further and study the concrete things that have not yet been thor-oughly studied or have only just emerged.

Our dogmatists are lazy-bones. They refuse to under-take any painstaking study of concrete things, they regard general truths as emerging out of the void, they turn them into purely abstract unfath-omable formulas, and thereby completely deny and reverse the normal sequence by which man comes to know truth. Nor do they understand the interconnection of the two processes in cog-nition — from the particular to the general and then from the general to the particular. They un-derstand nothing of the Marxist theory of knowledge.

It is necessary not only to study the particular contradiction and the essence determined thereby of every great system of the forms of mo-tion of matter, but also to study the particular contradiction and the essence of each process in the long course of development of each form of motion of matter. In every form of motion, each process of development which is real (and not im-aginary) is qualitatively different. Our study must emphasize and start from this point.

Qualitatively different contradictions can only be resolved by qualitatively different meth-ods. For instance, the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is resolved by the method of socialist revolution; the contradiction between the great masses of the people and the feudal system is resolved by the method of dem-ocratic revolution; the contradiction between the colonies and imperialism is resolved by the method of national revolutionary war; the con-tradiction between the working class and the peasant class in socialist society is resolved by the method of collectivization and mechanization in agriculture; contradiction within the Communist Party is resolved by the method of criticism and self-criticism; the contradiction between society and nature is resolved by the method of develop-ing the productive forces. Processes change, old processes and old contradictions disappear, new processes and new contradictions emerge, and the methods of resolving contradictions differ ac-cordingly.

In Russia, there was a fundamental difference between the contradiction resolved by the February Revolution and the contradiction resolved by the October Revolution, as well as between the methods used to resolve them. The principle of using different methods to resolve different contradictions is one which Marxist-Leninists must strictly observe. The dogmatists do not observe this principle; they do not under-stand that conditions differ in different kinds of revolution and so do not understand that differ-ent methods should be used to resolve different contradictions; on the contrary, they invariably adopt what they imagine to be an unalterable for-mula and arbitrarily apply it everywhere, which only causes setbacks to the revolution or makes a sorry mess of what was originally well done.

In order to reveal the particularity of the con-tradictions in any process in the development of a thing, in their totality or interconnections, that is, in order to reveal the essence of the process, it is necessary to reveal the particularity of the two aspects of each of the contradictions in that pro-cess; otherwise it will be impossible to discover the essence of the process. This likewise requires the utmost attention in our study.

There are many contradictions in the course of development of any major thing. For instance, in the course of China’s bourgeois-democratic revolution, where the conditions are exceedingly complex, there exist the contradiction between all the oppressed classes in Chinese society and im-perialism, the contradiction between the great masses of the people and feudalism, the contra-diction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the contradiction between the peasantry and the urban petty-bourgeoisie on the one hand and the bourgeoisie on the other, the contradiction between the various reactionary ruling groups, and so on. These contradictions cannot be treated in the same way since each has its own particularity; moreover, the two aspects of each contradiction cannot be treated in the same way since each aspect has its own characteristics.

We who are engaged in the Chinese revolution should not only understand the particularity of these contradictions in their totality, that is, in their interconnections, but should also study the two aspects of each contradiction as the only means of understanding the totality. When we speak of understanding each aspect of a contra-diction, we mean understanding what specific position each aspect occupies, what concrete forms it assumes in its interdependence and in its contradiction with its opposite, and what con-crete methods are employed in the struggle with its opposite, when the two are both interdepend-ent and in contradiction, and also after the interdependence breaks down. It is of great im-portance to study these problems. Lenin meant just this when he said that the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism, is the concrete analysis of concrete conditions.1 Our dogmatists have violated Lenin’s teachings; they never use their brains to analyse anything concretely, and in their writings and speeches they always use stereotypes devoid of content, thereby creating a very bad style of work in our Party.

In studying a problem, we must shun subjectivity, one-sidedness and superficiality. To be subjective means not to look at problems objec-tively, that is, not to use the materialist viewpoint in looking at problems. I have discussed this in my essay “On Practice.” To be one-sided means not to look at problems all-sidedly, for example, to understand only China but not Japan, only the Communist Party but not the Kuomintang, only the proletariat but not the bourgeoisie, only the peasants but not the landlords, only the favoura-ble conditions but not the difficult ones, only the past but not the future, only individual parts but not the whole, only the defects but not the achievements, only the plaintiff’s case but not the defendant’s, only underground revolutionary work but not open revolutionary work, and so on. In a word, it means not to understand the characteristics of both aspects of a contradiction. This is what we mean by looking at a problem one-sidedly. Or it may be called seeing the part but not the whole, seeing the trees but not the for-est. That way it is impossible to find the method for resolving a contradiction, it is impossible to accomplish the tasks of the revolution, to carry out assignments well or to develop inner-Party ideological struggle correctly.

See “Problems of Strategy in China’s Revolutionary War,” Note 2, p. 249 of Mao Tse-tung, Selected Works, referring to the two sides in a battle. Wei Cheng1 of the Tang Dynasty also understood the error of one-sidedness when he said, “Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened, heed only one side and you will be benighted.” But our comrades of-ten look at problems one-sidedly, and so they often run into snags. In the novel Shui Hu Chuan,

Sung Chiang thrice attacked Chu Village.2 Twice he was defeated because he was ignorant of the local conditions and used the wrong method. Later he changed his method; first he investi-gated the situation, and he familiarized himself with the maze of roads, then he broke up the al-liance between the Li, Hu and Chu Villages and sent his men in disguise into the enemy camp to lie in wait, using a stratagem similar to that of the Trojan Horse in the foreign story. And on the third occasion he won. There are many examples of materialist dialectics in Shui Hu Chuan, of which the episode of the three attacks on Chu Village is one of the best.

Shui Hu Chuan (Heroes of the Marshes), a famous 14th century Chinese novel, describes a peasant war towards the end of the Northern Sung Dynasty. Chu Village was in the vicinity of Liangshanpo, where Sung Chiang, leader of the peasant uprising and hero of the novel, established his base. Chu Chao-feng, the head of this village, was a despotic landlord.

We should remember his words. To be superficial means to consider neither the characteris-tics of a contradiction in its totality nor the char-acteristics of each of its aspects; it means to deny the necessity for probing deeply into a thing and minutely studying the characteristics of its con-tradiction, but instead merely to look from afar and, after glimpsing the rough outline, immedi-ately to try to resolve the contradiction (to an-swer a question, settle a dispute, handle work, or direct a military operation). This way of doing things is bound to lead to trouble. The reason the dogmatist and empiricist comrades in China have made mistakes lies precisely in their subjec-tivist, one-sided and superficial way of looking at things. To be one-sided and superficial is at the same time to be subjective. For all objective things are actually interconnected and are gov-erned by inner laws, but instead of undertaking the task of reflecting things as they really are some people only look at things one-sidedly or superficially and who know neither their inter-connections nor their inner laws, and so their method is subjectivist.

Not only does the whole process of the move-ment of opposites in the development of a thing, both in their interconnections and in each of the aspects, have particular features to which we must give attention, but each stage in the process has its particular features to which we must give attention too.

The fundamental contradiction in the pro-cess of development of a thing and the essence of the process determined by this fundamental con-tradiction will not disappear until the process is completed; but in a lengthy process the condi-tions usually differ at each stage. The reason is that, although the nature of the fundamental contradiction in the process of development of a thing and the essence of the process remain unchanged, the fundamental contradiction be-comes more and more intensified as it passes from one stage to another in the lengthy process. In addition, among the numerous major and mi-nor contradictions which are determined or influ-enced by the fundamental contradiction, some become intensified, some are temporarily or par-tially resolved or mitigated, and some new ones emerge; hence the process is marked by stages. If people do not pay attention to the stages in the process of development of a thing, they cannot deal with its contradictions properly.

For instance, when the capitalism of the era of free competition developed into imperialism, there was no change in the class nature of the two classes in fundamental contradiction, namely, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, or in the cap-italist essence of society; however, the contradic-tion between these two classes became intensi-fied, the contradiction between monopoly and non-monopoly capital emerged, the contradic-tion between the colonial powers and the colonies became intensified, the contradiction among the capitalist countries resulting from their une-ven development manifested itself with particular sharpness, and thus there arose the special stage of capitalism, the stage of imperialism. Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and pro-letarian revolution precisely because Lenin and Stalin have correctly explained these contradic-tions and correctly formulated the theory and tactics of the proletarian revolution for their resolution.

Take the process of China’s bourgeois-dem-ocratic revolution, which began with the Revolu-tion of 1911; it, too, has several distinct stages. In particular, the revolution in its period of bour-geois leadership and the revolution in its period of proletarian leadership represent two vastly dif-ferent historical stages. In other words, proletar-ian leadership has fundamentally changed the whole face of the revolution, has brought about a new alignment of classes, given rise to a tremen-dous upsurge in the peasant revolution, imparted thoroughness to the revolution against imperial-ism and feudalism, created the possibility of the transition from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, and so on. None of these was possible in the period when the revolution was under bourgeois leadership. Although no change has taken place in the nature of the fundamental contradiction in the process as a whole, i.e., in the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, democratic-revolu-tionary nature of the process (the opposite of which is its semi-colonial and semi-feudal na-ture), nonetheless this process has passed through several stages of development in the course of more than twenty years; during this time many great events have taken place — the failure of the Revolution of 1911 and the estab-lishment of the regime of the Northern warlords, the formation of the first national united front and the revolution of 1924-27, the break-up of the united front and the desertion of the bour-geoisie to the side of the counter-revolution, the wars among the new warlords, the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the establishment of the second national united front and the War of Resistance Against Japan.

These stages are marked by par-ticular features such as the intensification of cer-tain contradictions (e.g., the Agrarian Revolu-tionary War and the Japanese invasion of the four northeastern provinces), the partial or tem-porary resolution of other contradictions (e.g., the destruction of the Northern warlords and our confiscation of the land of the landlords), and the emergence of yet other contradictions (e.g., the conflicts among the new warlords, and the land-lords’ recapture of the land after the loss of our revolutionary base areas in the south).

In studying the particularities of the contra-dictions at each stage in the process of develop-ment of a thing, we must not only observe them in their interconnections or their totality, we must also examine the two aspects of each con-tradiction.

For instance, consider the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Take one aspect, the Kuo-mintang. In the period of the first united front, the Kuomintang carried out Sun Yat-sen’s Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, co-opera-tion with the Communist Party, and assistance to the peasants and workers; hence it was revolu-tionary and vigorous, it was an alliance of vari-ous classes for the democratic revolution. After 1927, however, the Kuomintang changed into its opposite and became a reactionary bloc of the landlords and big bourgeoisie. After the Sian In-cident in December 1936, it began another change in the direction of ending the civil war and co-operating with the Communist Party for joint opposition to Japanese imperialism. Such have been the particular features of the Kuomin-tang in the three stages. Of course, these features have arisen from a variety of causes. Now take the other aspect, the Chinese Communist Party.

In the period of the first united front, the Chinese Communist Party was in its infancy; it coura-geously led the revolution of 1924-27 but re-vealed its immaturity in its understanding of the character, the tasks and the methods of the revo-lution, and consequently it became possible for Chen Tu-hsiuism, which appeared during the lat-ter part of this revolution, to assert itself and bring about the defeat of the revolution. After 1927, the Communist Party courageously led the Agrarian Revolutionary War and created the revolutionary army and revolutionary base areas; however, it committed adventurist errors which brought about very great losses both to the army and to the base areas. Since 1935 the Party has corrected these errors and has been leading the new united front for resistance to Japan; this great struggle is now developing. At the present stage, the Communist Party is a Party that has gone through the test of two revolutions and ac-quired a wealth of experience. Such have been the particular features of the Chinese Communist Party in the three stages. These features, too, have arisen from a variety of causes.

Without studying both these sets of features we cannot un-derstand the particular relations between the two parties during the various stages of their develop-ment, namely, the establishment of a united front, the break-up of the united front, and the establishment of another united front. What is even more fundamental for the study of the particular features of the two parties is the examina-tion of the class basis of the two parties and the resultant contradictions which have arisen be-tween each party and other forces at different pe-riods. For instance, in the period of its first co-operation with the Communist Party, the Kuo-mintang stood in contradiction to foreign impe-rialism and was therefore anti-imperialist; on the other hand, it stood in contradiction to the great masses of the people within the country — alt-hough in words it promised many benefits to the working people, in fact it gave them little or noth-ing.

In the period when it carried on the anti-Communist war, the Kuomintang collaborated with imperialism and feudalism against the great masses of the people and wiped out all the gains they had won in the revolution, and thereby in-tensified its contradictions with them. In the pre-sent period of the anti-Japanese war, the Kuo-mintang stands in contradiction to Japanese im-perialism and wants co-operation with the Com-munist Party, without however relaxing its strug-gle against the Communist Party and the people or its oppression of them. As for the Communist Party, it has always, in every period, stood with the great masses of the people against imperial-ism and feudalism, but in the present period of the anti-Japanese war, it has adopted a moderate policy towards the Kuomintang and the domes-tic feudal forces because the Kuomintang has ex-pressed itself in favour of resisting Japan. The above circumstances have resulted now in alliance between the two parties and now in struggle between them, and even during the periods of al-liance there has been a complicated state of sim-ultaneous alliance and struggle. If we do not study the particular features of both aspects of the contradiction, we shall fail to understand not only the relations of each party with the other forces, but also the relations between the two parties.

It can thus be seen that in studying the par-ticularity of any kind of contradiction — the con-tradiction in each form of motion of matter, the contradiction in each of its processes of development, the two aspects of the contradiction in each process, the contradiction at each stage of a pro-cess, and the two aspects of the contradiction at each stage — in studying the particularity of all these contradictions, we must not be subjective and arbitrary but must analyse it concretely. Without concrete analysis there can be no knowledge of the particularity of any contradic-tion. We must always remember Lenin’s words, the concrete analysis of concrete conditions.

Marx and Engels were the first to provide us with excellent models of such concrete analysis.

When Marx and Engels applied the law of contradiction in things to the study of the socio-historical process, they discovered the contradic-tion between the productive forces and the rela-tions of production, they discovered the contra-diction between the exploiting and exploited clas-ses and also the resultant contradiction between the economic base and its superstructure (poli-tics, ideology, etc.), and they discovered how these contradictions inevitably lead to different kinds of social revolution in different kinds of class society.

When Marx applied this law to the study of the economic structure of capitalist society, he discovered that the basic contradiction of this so-ciety is the contradiction between the social char-acter of production and the private character of ownership. This contradiction manifests itself in the contradiction between the organized charac-ter of production in individual enterprises and the anarchic character of production in society as a whole. In terms of class relations, it manifests itself in the contradiction between the bourgeoi-sie and the proletariat.

Because the range of things is vast and there is no limit to their development, what is universal in one context becomes particular in another. Conversely, what is particular in one context be-comes universal in another. The contradiction in the capitalist system between the social character of production and the private ownership of the means of production is common to all countries where capitalism exists and develops; as far as capitalism is concerned, this constitutes the uni-versality of contradiction. But this contradiction of capitalism belongs only to a certain historical stage in the general development of class society; as far as the contradiction between the produc-tive forces and the relations of production in class society as a whole is concerned, it constitutes the particularity of contradiction. However, in the course of dissecting the particularity of all these contradictions in capitalist society, Marx gave a still more profound, more adequate and more complete elucidation of the universality of the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production in class society in gen-eral.

Since the particular is united with the univer-sal and since the universality as well as the par-ticularity of contradiction is inherent in every-thing, universality residing in particularity, we should, when studying an object, try to discover both the particular and the universal and their in-terconnection, to discover both particularity and universality and also their interconnection within the object itself, and to discover the interconnec-tions of this object with the many objects outside it. When Stalin explained the historical roots of Leninism in his famous work, The Foundations of Leninism, he analysed the international situation in which Leninism arose, analysed those contra-dictions of capitalism which reached their culmi-nation under imperialism, and showed how these contradictions made proletarian revolution a matter for immediate action and created favour-able conditions for a direct onslaught on capital-ism. What is more, he analysed the reasons why Russia became the cradle of Leninism, why Tsar-ist Russia became the focus of all the contradictions of imperialism, and why it was possible for the Russian proletariat to become the vanguard of the international revolutionary proletariat. Thus, Stalin analysed the universality of contra-diction in imperialism, showing why Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and prole-tarian revolution, and at the same time analysed the particularity of Tsarist Russian imperialism within this general contradiction, showing why Russia became the birthplace of the theory and tactics of proletarian revolution and how the uni-versality of contradiction is contained in this par-ticularity. Stalin’s analysis provides us with a model for understanding the particularity and the universality of contradiction and their inter-connection.

On the question of using dialectics in the study of objective phenomena, Marx and Engels, and likewise Lenin and Stalin, always enjoin peo-ple not to be in any way subjective and arbitrary but, from the concrete conditions in the actual objective movement of these phenomena, to dis-cover their concrete contradictions, the concrete position of each aspect of every contradiction and the concrete interrelations of the contradic-tions. Our dogmatists do not have this attitude in study and therefore can never get anything right. We must take warning from their failure and learn to acquire this attitude which is the only correct one in study.

The relationship between the universality and the particularity of contradiction is the rela-tionship between the general character and the individual character of contradiction. By the for-mer we mean that contradiction exists in and runs through all processes from beginning to end; motion, things, processes, thinking — all are con-tradictions. To deny contradiction is to deny eve-rything. This is a universal truth for all times and all countries, which admits of no exception. Hence the general character, the absoluteness of contradiction. But this general character is con-tained in every individual character; without in-dividual character there can be no general char-acter. If all individual character were removed, what general character would remain? It is because each contradiction is particular that indi-vidual character arises. All individual character exists conditionally and temporarily and hence is relative.

This truth concerning general and individual character, concerning absoluteness and relativ-ity, is the quintessence of the problem of contra-diction in things; failure to understand it is tan-tamount to abandoning dialectics.

There are still two points in the problem of the particularity of contradiction which must be singled out for analysis, namely, the principal contradiction and the principal aspect of a con-tradiction.

There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions.

For instance, in capitalist society the two forces in contradiction, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, form the principal contradiction. The other contradictions, such as those between the remnant feudal class and the bourgeoisie, be-tween the peasant petty-bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie, between the proletariat and the peasant petty-bourgeoisie, between the non-monopoly capitalists and the monopoly capitalists, between bourgeois democracy and bourgeois fas-cism, among the capitalist countries and between imperialism and the colonies, are all determined or influenced by this principal contradiction.

In a semi-colonial country such as China, the relationship between the principal contradiction and the non-principal contradictions presents a complicated picture.

When imperialism launches a war of aggres-sion against such a country, all its various classes, except for some traitors, can temporarily unite in a national war against imperialism. At such a time, the contradiction between imperialism and the country concerned becomes the principal contradiction, while all the contradictions among the various classes within the country (including what was the principal contradiction, between the feudal system and the great masses of the peo-ple) are temporarily relegated to a secondary and subordinate position. So it was in China in the Opium War of 1840, the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and the Yi Ho Tuan War of 1900, and so it is now in the present Sino-Japanese War.

But in another situation, the contradictions change position. When imperialism carries on its oppression not by war, but by milder means — political, economic and cultural — the ruling classes in semi-colonial countries capitulate to imperialism, and the two form an alliance for the joint oppression of the masses of the people. At such a time, the masses often resort to civil war against the alliance of imperialism and the feudal classes, while imperialism often employs indirect methods rather than direct action in helping the reactionaries in the semi-colonial countries to op-press the people, and thus the internal contradic-tions become particularly sharp. This is what happened in China in the Revolutionary War of 1911, the Revolutionary War of 1924-27, and the ten years of Agrarian Revolutionary War after 1927. Wars among the various reactionary ruling groups in the semi-colonial countries, e.g., the wars among the warlords in China, fall into the same category.

When a revolutionary civil war develops to the point of threatening the very existence of im-perialism and its running dogs, the domestic re-actionaries, imperialism often adopts other methods in order to maintain its rule; it either tries to split the revolutionary front from within or sends armed forces to help the domestic reac-tionaries directly. At such a time, foreign imperialism and domestic reaction stand quite openly at one pole while the masses of the people stand at the other pole, thus forming the principal con-tradiction which determines or influences the de-velopment of the other contradictions. The assis-tance given by various capitalist countries to the Russian reactionaries after the October Revolu-tion is an example of armed intervention. Chiang Kai-shek’s betrayal in 1927 is an example of split-ting the revolutionary front.

But whatever happens, there is no doubt at all that at every stage in the development of a process, there is only one principal contradiction which plays the leading role.

Hence, if in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must be the prin-cipal contradiction playing the leading and deci-sive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved. This is the method Marx taught us in his study of capitalist society. Like-wise Lenin and Stalin taught us this method when they studied imperialism and the general crisis of capitalism and when they studied the So-viet economy. There are thousands of scholars and men of action who do not understand it, and the result is that, lost in a fog, they are unable to get to the heart of a problem and naturally can-not find a way to resolve its contradictions.

As we have said, one must not treat all the contradictions in a process as being equal but must distinguish between the principal and the secondary contradictions, and pay special atten-tion to grasping the principal one. But, in any given contradiction, whether principal or second-ary, should the two contradictory aspects be treated as equal? Again, no. In any contradiction the development of the contradictory aspects is uneven. Sometimes they seem to be in equilib-rium, which is however only temporary and rela-tive, while unevenness is basic. Of the two con-tradictory aspects, one must be principal and the other secondary. The principal aspect is the one playing the leading role in the contradiction. The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the principal aspect of a contradiction, the aspect which has gained the dominant position.

But this situation is not static; the principal and the non-principal aspects of a contradiction transform themselves into each other and the na-ture of the thing changes accordingly. In a given process or at a given stage in the development of a contradiction, A is the principal aspect and B is the non-principal aspect; at another stage or in another process the roles are reversed — a change determined by the extent of the increase or decrease in the force of each aspect in its strug-gle against the other in the course of the develop-ment of a thing.

We often speak of “the new superseding the old.” The supersession of the old by the new is a general, eternal and inviolable law of the uni-verse. The transformation of one thing into an-other, through leaps of different forms in accord-ance with its essence and external conditions — this is the process of the new superseding the old. In each thing there is contradiction between its new and its old aspects, and this gives rise to a series of struggles with many twists and turns. As a result of these struggles, the new aspect changes from being minor to being major and rises to pre-dominance, while the old aspect changes from being major to being minor and gradually dies out. And the moment the new aspect gains dom-inance over the old, the old thing changes quali-tatively into a new thing. It can thus be seen that the nature of a thing is mainly determined by the principal aspect of the contradiction, the aspect which has gained predominance. When the prin-cipal aspect which has gained predominance changes, the nature of a thing changes accord-ingly.

In capitalist society, capitalism has changed its position from being a subordinate force in the old feudal era to being the dominant force, and the nature of society has accordingly changed from feudal to capitalist. In the new, capitalist era, the feudal forces changed from their former dominant position to a subordinate one, gradu-ally dying out. Such was the case, for example, in Britain and France. With the development of the productive forces, the bourgeoisie changes from being a new class playing a progressive role to being an old class playing a reactionary role, until it is finally overthrown by the proletariat and be-comes a class deprived of privately owned means of production and stripped of power, when it, too, gradually dies out. The proletariat, which is much more numerous than the bourgeoisie and grows simultaneously with it but under its rule, is a new force which, initially subordinate to the bourgeoisie, gradually gains strength, becomes an independent class playing the leading role in history, and finally seizes political power and be-comes the ruling class. Thereupon the nature of society changes and the old capitalist society be-comes the new socialist society. This is the path already taken by the Soviet Union, a path that all other countries will inevitably take.

Look at China, for instance. Imperialism oc-cupies the principal position in the contradiction in which China has been reduced to a semi-col-ony, it oppresses the Chinese people, and China has been changed from an independent country into a semi-colonial one. But this state of affairs will inevitably change; in the struggle between the two sides, the power of the Chinese people which is growing under the leadership of the proletariat will inevitably change China from a semi-colony into an independent country, whereas imperial-ism will be overthrown and old China will inevi-tably change into New China.

The change of old China into New China also involves a change in the relation between the old feudal forces and the new popular forces within the country. The old feudal landlord class will be overthrown, and from being the ruler it will change into being the ruled; and this class, too, will gradually die out. From being the ruled the people, led by the proletariat, will become the rulers. Thereupon, the nature of Chinese society will change and the old, semi-colonial and semi-feudal society will change into a new democratic society.

Instances of such reciprocal transformation are found in our past experience. The Ching Dynasty which ruled China for nearly three hun-dred years was overthrown in the Revolution of 1911, and the revolutionary Tung Meng Hui un-der Sun Yat-sen’s leadership was victorious for a time. In the Revolutionary War of 1924-27, the revolutionary forces of the Communist-Kuomin-tang alliance in the south changed from being weak to being strong and won victory in the Northern Expedition, while the Northern war-lords who once ruled the roost were overthrown. In 1927, the people’s forces led by the Communist Party were greatly reduced numerically under the attacks of Kuomintang reaction, but with the elimination of opportunism within their ranks they gradually grew again. In the revolu-tionary base areas under Communist leadership, the peasants have been transformed from being the ruled to being the rulers, while the landlords have undergone a reverse transformation. It is al-ways so in the world, the new displacing the old, the old being superseded by the new, the old being eliminated to make way for the new, and the new emerging out of the old.

At certain times in the revolutionary struggle, the difficulties outweigh the favourable condi-tions and so constitute the principal aspect of the contradiction and the favourable conditions con-stitute the secondary aspect. But through their ef-forts the revolutionaries can overcome the diffi-culties step by step and open up a favourable new situation; thus a difficult situation yields place to a favourable one. This is what happened after the failure of the revolution in China in 1927 and during the Long March of the Chinese Red Army. In the present Sino-Japanese War, China is again in a difficult position, but we can change this and fundamentally transform the situation as between China and Japan. Conversely, fa-vourable conditions can be transformed into dif-ficulty if the revolutionaries make mistakes. Thus the victory of the revolution of 1924-27 turned into defeat. The revolutionary base areas which grew up in the southern provinces after 1927 had all suffered defeat by 1934.

When we engage in study, the same holds good for the contradiction in the passage from ignorance to knowledge. At the very beginning of our study of Marxism, our ignorance of or scanty acquaintance with Marxism stands in contradic-tion to knowledge of Marxism. But by assiduous study, ignorance can be transformed into knowledge, scanty knowledge into substantial knowledge, and blindness in the application of Marxism into mastery of its application.

Some people think that this is not true of cer-tain contradictions. For instance, in the contra-diction between the productive forces and the re-lations of production, the productive forces are the principal aspect; in the contradiction between theory and practice, practice is the principal as-pect; in the contradiction between the economic base and the superstructure, the economic base is the principal aspect; and there is no change in their respective positions. This is the mechanical materialist conception, not the dialectical materi-alist conception. True, the productive forces, practice and the economic base generally play the principal and decisive role; whoever denies this is not a materialist. But it must also be admitted that in certain conditions, such aspects as the re-lations of production, theory and the superstruc-ture in turn manifest themselves in the principal and decisive role.

When it is impossible for the productive forces to develop without a change in the relations of production, then the change in the relations of production plays the principal and decisive role. The creation and advocacy of revolutionary theory plays the principal and de-cisive role in those times of which Lenin said, “Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement.”1 When a task, no matter which, has to be performed, but there is as yet no guiding line, method, plan or policy, the principal and decisive thing is to decide on a guiding line, method, plan or policy. When the superstructure (politics, culture, etc.) obstructs the development of the economic base, political and cultural changes become principal and deci-sive. Are we going against materialism when we say this? No. The reason is that while we recog-nize that in the general development of history the material determines the mental and social be-ing determines social consciousness, we also — and indeed must — recognize the reaction of mental on material things, of social conscious-ness on social being and of the superstructure on the economic base.

In studying the particularity of contradic-tion, unless we examine these two facets — the principal and the non-principal contradictions in a process, and the principal and the non-principal aspects of a contradiction — that is, unless we examine the distinctive character of these two facets of contradiction, we shall get bogged down in abstractions, be unable to understand contra-diction concretely and consequently be unable to find the correct method of resolving it. The dis-tinctive character or particularity of these two facets of contradiction represents the unevenness of the forces that are in contradiction. Nothing in this world develops absolutely evenly; we must oppose the theory of even development or the theory of equilibrium. Moreover, it is these con-crete features of a contradiction and the changes in the principal and non-principal aspects of a contradiction in the course of its development that manifest the force of the new superseding the old. The study of the various states of unevenness in contradictions, of the principal and non-prin-cipal contradictions and of the principal and the non-principal aspects of a contradiction consti-tutes an essential method by which a revolution-ary political party correctly determines its strate-gic and tactical policies both in political and in military affairs. All Communists must give it at-tention.

When we understand the universality and the particularity of contradiction, we must proceed to study the problem of the identity and struggle of the aspects of a contradiction.

Identity, unity, coincidence, interpenetra-tion, interpermeation, interdependence (or mu-tual dependence for existence), interconnection or mutual co-operation — all these different terms mean the same thing and refer to the fol-lowing two points: first, the existence of each of the two aspects of a contradiction in the process of the development of a thing presupposes the ex-istence of the other aspect, and both aspects co-exist in a single entity; second, in given condi-tions, each of the two contradictory aspects transforms itself into its opposite. This is the meaning of identity.

Lenin said: “Dialectics is the teaching which shows how opposites can be and how they happen to be (how they become) identical — under what conditions they are identical, transforming themselves into one another, — why the human mind should take these opposites not as dead, rigid, but as living, conditional, mobile, transforming themselves into one another.”

What does this passage mean?

The contradictory aspects in every process exclude each other, struggle with each other and are in opposition to each other. Without excep-tion, they are contained in the process of development of all things and in all human thought. A simple process contains only a single pair of op-posites, while a complex process contains more. And in turn, the pairs of opposites are in contra-diction to one another. That is how all things in the objective world and all human thought are constituted and how they are set in motion.

This being so, there is an utter lack of identity or unity. How then can one speak of identity or unity?

The fact is that no contradictory aspect can exist in isolation. Without its opposite aspect, each loses the condition for its existence. Just think, can any one contradictory aspect of a thing or of a concept in the human mind exist in-dependently? Without life, there would be no death; without death, there would be no life. Without “above,” there would be no “below”; without “below,” there would be no “above.”

Without misfortune, there would be no good for-tune; without good fortune, there would be no misfortune. Without landlords, there would be no tenant-peasants; without tenant-peasants, there would be no landlords. Without the bourgeoisie, there would be no proletariat; without the prole-tariat, there would be no bourgeoisie. Without imperialist oppression of nations, there would be no colonies or semi-colonies; without colonies or semi-colonies, there would be no imperialist op-pression of nations. It is so with all opposites; in given conditions, on the one hand they are op-posed to each other, and on the other they are in-terconnected, interpenetrating, interpermeating and interdependent, and this character is de-scribed as identity. In given conditions, all con-tradictory aspects possess the character of non-identity and hence are described as being in contradiction. But they also possess the character of identity and hence are interconnected. This is what Lenin means when he says that dialectics studies “how opposites can be... identical.” How then can they be identical? Because each is the condition for the other’s existence. This is the first meaning of identity.

But is it enough to say merely that each of the contradictory aspects is the condition for the other’s existence, that there is identity between them and that consequently they can coexist in a single entity? No, it is not. The matter does not end with their dependence on each other for their existence; what is more important is their trans-formation into each other. That is to say, in given conditions, each of the contradictory aspects within a thing transforms itself into its opposite, changes its position to that of its opposite. This is the second meaning of the identity of contra-diction.

Why is there identity here, too? You see, by means of revolution the proletariat, at one time the ruled, is transformed into the ruler, while the bourgeoisie, the erstwhile ruler, is transformed into the ruled and changes its position to that originally occupied by its opposite. This has al-ready taken place in the Soviet Union, as it will take place throughout the world. If there were no interconnection and identity of opposites in given conditions, how could such a change take place?

The Kuomintang, which played a certain positive role at a certain stage in modern Chinese history, became a counter-revolutionary party after 1927 because of its inherent class nature and because of imperialist blandishments (these being the conditions); but it has been compelled to agree to resist Japan because of the sharpening of the contradiction between China and Japan and because of the Communist Party’s policy of the united front (these being the conditions). Things in contradiction change into one another, and herein lies a definite identity.

Our agrarian revolution has been a process in which the landlord class owning the land is trans-formed into a class that has lost its land, while the peasants who once lost their land are trans-formed into small holders who have acquired land, and it will be such a process once again. In given conditions having and not having, acquir-ing and losing, are interconnected; there is iden-tity of the two sides. Under socialism, private peasant ownership is transformed into the public ownership of socialist agriculture; this has already taken place in the Soviet Union, as it will take place everywhere else. There is a bridge lead-ing from private property to public property, which in philosophy is called identity, or trans-formation into each other, or interpenetration.

To consolidate the dictatorship of the prole-tariat or the dictatorship of the people is in fact to prepare the conditions for abolishing this dic-tatorship and advancing to the higher stage when all state systems are eliminated. To establish and build the Communist Party is in fact to prepare the conditions for the elimination of the Com-munist Party and all political parties. To build a revolutionary army under the leadership of the Communist Party and to carry on revolutionary war is in fact to prepare the conditions for the permanent elimination of war. These opposites are at the same time complementary.

War and peace, as everybody knows, transform themselves into each other. War is trans-formed into peace; for instance, the First World War was transformed into the post-war peace, and the civil war in China has now stopped, giv-ing place to internal peace. Peace is transformed into war; for instance, the Kuomintang-Com-munist co-operation was transformed into war in 1927, and today’s situation of world peace may be transformed into a second world war. Why is this so? Because in class society such contradic-tory things as war and peace have an identity in given conditions.

All contradictory things are interconnected; not only do they coexist in a single entity in given conditions, but in other given conditions, they also transform themselves into each other. This is the full meaning of the identity of opposites. This is what Lenin meant when he discussed “how they happen to be (how they become) identical — under what conditions they are identical, transforming themselves into one another.”

Why is it that “the human mind should take these opposites not as dead, rigid, but as living, conditional, mobile, transforming themselves into one another”? Because that is just how things are in objective reality. The fact is that the unity or identity of opposites in objective things is not dead or rigid, but is living, conditional, mo-bile, temporary and relative; in given conditions, every contradictory aspect transforms itself into its opposite. Reflected in man’s thinking, this becomes the Marxist world outlook of materialist dialectics. It is only the reactionary ruling classes of the past and present and the metaphysicians in their service who regard opposites not as living, conditional, mobile and transforming themselves into one another, but as dead and rigid, and they propagate this fallacy everywhere to delude the masses of the people, thus seeking to perpetuate their rule. The task of Communists is to expose the fallacies of the reactionaries and metaphysi-cians, to propagate the dialectics inherent in things, and so accelerate the transformation of things and achieve the goal of revolution.

In speaking of the identity of opposites in given conditions, what we are referring to is real and concrete opposites and the real and concrete transformations of opposites into one another. There are innumerable transformations in my-thology, for instance, Kua Fu’s race with the sun in Shan Hai Ching,1 Yi’s shooting down of nine suns in Huai Nan Tzu, 2 the Monkey King’s seventy-two metamorphoses in Hsi Yu Chi,3 the nu-merous episodes of ghosts and foxes metamorphosed into human beings in the Strange Tales of Shan Hai Ching (Book of Mountains and Seas) was written in the era of the Warring States (403-221 B.C.). In one of its fables Kua Fu, a superman, pursued and overtook the sun. But he died of thirst, whereupon his staff was trans-formed into the forest of Teng.

Yi is one of the legendary heroes of ancient China, fa-mous for his archery. According to a legend in Huai Nan Tzu, compiled in the 2nd century B.C., there were ten suns in the sky in the days of Emperor Yao. To put an end to the damage to vegetation caused by these scorching suns, Em-peror Yao ordered Yi to shoot them down. In another leg-end recorded by Wang Yi (2nd century A.D.), the archer is said to have shot down nine of the ten suns.

Hsi Yu Chi (Pilgrimage to the West) is a 16th century novel, the hero of which is the monkey god Sun Wu-kung. He could miraculously change at will into seventy-two dif-ferent shapes, such as a bird, a tree and a stone.

Liao Chai, etc. But these legendary transfor-mations of opposites are not concrete changes re-flecting concrete contradictions. They are naive, imaginary, subjectively conceived transformations conjured up in men’s minds by innumer-able real and complex transformations of oppo-sites into one another. Marx said, “All mythol-ogy masters and dominates and shapes the forces of nature in and through the imagination; hence it disappears as soon as man gains mastery over the forces of nature.”2 The myriads of changes in mythology (and also in nursery tales) delight peo-ple because they imaginatively picture man’s con-quest of the forces of nature, and the best myths possess “eternal charm,” as Marx put it; but myths are not built out of the concrete contradic-tions existing in given conditions and therefore are not a scientific reflection of reality. That is to say, in myths or nursery tales the aspects consti-tuting a contradiction have only an imaginary identity, not a concrete identity. The scientific re-flection of the identity in real transformations is Marxist dialectics.

Why can an egg but not a stone be trans-formed into a chicken? Why is there identity be-tween war and peace and none between war and a stone?

Why is it that in Russia in 1917 the bourgeois-democratic February Revolution was di-rectly linked with the proletarian socialist Octo-ber Revolution, while in France the bourgeois revolution was not directly linked with a socialist revolution and the Paris Commune of 1871 ended in failure? Why is it, on the other hand, that the nomadic system of Mongolia and Cen-tral Asia has been directly linked with socialism? Why is it that the Chinese revolution can avoid a capitalist future and be directly linked with socialism without taking the old historical road of the Western countries, without passing through a period of bourgeois dictatorship? The sole rea-son is the concrete conditions of the time. When certain necessary conditions are present, certain contradictions arise in the process of develop-ment of things and, moreover, the opposites con-tained in them are interdependent and become transformed into one another; otherwise none of this would be possible.

Such is the problem of identity. What then is struggle? And what is the relation between iden-tity and struggle?

Lenin said: “The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development and motion are absolute.”



What does this passage mean?

All processes have a beginning and an end, all processes transform themselves into their op-posites. The constancy of all processes is relative, but the mutability manifested in the transfor-mation of one process into another is absolute.

There are two states of motion in all things, that of relative rest and that of conspicuous change. Both are caused by the struggle between the two contradictory elements contained in a thing. When the thing is in the first state of mo-tion, it is undergoing only quantitative and not qualitative change and consequently presents the outward appearance of being at rest. When the thing is in the second state of motion, the quan-titative change of the first state has already reached a culminating point and gives rise to the dissolution of the thing as an entity and there-upon a qualitative change ensues, hence the ap-pearance of a conspicuous change. Such unity, solidarity, combination, harmony, balance, stalemate, deadlock, rest, constancy, equilibrium, solidity, attraction, etc., as we see in daily life, are all the appearances of things in the state of quantitative change. On the other hand, the dissolution of unity, that is, the destruction of this solidarity, combination, harmony, balance, stalemate, deadlock, rest, constancy, equilib-rium, solidity and attraction, and the change of each into its opposite are all the appearances of things in the state of qualitative change, the transformation of one process into another. Things are constantly transforming themselves from the first into the second state of motion; the struggle of opposites goes on in both states but the contradiction is resolved through the second state. That is why we say that the unity of oppo-sites is conditional, temporary and relative, while the struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is ab-solute.

When we said above that two opposite things can coexist in a single entity and can transform themselves into each other because there is iden-tity between them, we were speaking of condi-tionality, that is to say, in given conditions two contradictory things can be united and can trans-form themselves into each other, but in the ab-sence of these conditions, they cannot constitute a contradiction, cannot coexist in the same entity and cannot transform themselves into one another. It is because the identity of opposites ob-tains only in given conditions that we have said identity is conditional and relative. We may add that the struggle between opposites permeates a process from beginning to end and makes one process transform itself into another, that it is ubiquitous, and that struggle is therefore uncon-ditional and absolute.

The combination of conditional, relative identity and unconditional, absolute struggle constitutes the movement of opposites in all things.

We Chinese often say, “Things that oppose each other also complement each other.”1 That is, things opposed to each other have identity. This saying is dialectical and contrary to meta-physics. “Oppose each other” refers to the mu-tual exclusion or the struggle of two contradic-tory aspects. “Complement each other” means that in given conditions the two contradictory as-pects unite and achieve identity. Yet struggle is inherent in identity and without struggle there can be no identity.

In identity there is struggle, in particularity there is universality, and in individuality there is generality. To quote Lenin, “...there is an absolute in the relative.”

The saying “Things that oppose each other also com-plement each other” first appeared in the History of the Ear-lier Han Dynasty by Pan Ku, a celebrated historian in the 1st century A.D. It has long been a popular saying.

The question of the struggle of opposites includes the question of what is antagonism. Our answer is that antagonism is one form, but not the only form, of the struggle of opposites.

In human history, antagonism between clas-ses exists as a particular manifestation of the struggle of opposites. Consider the contradiction between the exploiting and the exploited classes. Such contradictory classes coexist for a long time in the same society, be it slave society, feudal society or capitalist society, and they struggle with each other; but it is not until the contradiction between the two classes develops to a certain stage that it assumes the form of open antago-nism and develops into revolution. The same holds for the transformation of peace into war in class society.

Before it explodes, a bomb is a single entity in which opposites coexist in given conditions. The explosion takes place only when a new condition, ignition, is present. An analogous situa-tion arises in all those natural phenomena which finally assume the form of open conflict to re-solve old contradictions and produce new things.

It is highly important to grasp this fact. It en-ables us to understand that revolutions and rev-olutionary wars are inevitable in class society and that without them, it is impossible to accomplish any leap in social development and to overthrow the reactionary ruling classes and therefore im-possible for the people to win political power. Communists must expose the deceitful propa-ganda of the reactionaries, such as the assertion that social revolution is unnecessary and impos-sible. They must firmly uphold the Marxist-Len-inist theory of social revolution and enable the people to understand that social revolution is not only entirely necessary but also entirely practica-ble, and that the whole history of mankind and the triumph of the Soviet Union have confirmed this scientific truth.

However, we must make a concrete study of the circumstances of each specific struggle of opposites and should not arbitrarily apply the for-mula discussed above to everything. Contradic-tion and struggle are universal and absolute, but the methods of resolving contradictions, that is, the forms of struggle, differ according to the dif-ferences in the nature of the contradictions. Some contradictions are characterized by open antago-nism, others are not. In accordance with the con-crete development of things, some contradictions which were originally non-antagonistic develop into antagonistic ones, while others which were originally antagonistic develop into non-antago-nistic ones.

As already mentioned, so long as classes ex-ist, contradictions between correct and incorrect ideas in the Communist Party are reflections within the Party of class contradictions. At first, with regard to certain issues, such contradictions may not manifest themselves as antagonistic. But with the development of the class struggle, they may grow and become antagonistic. The history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union shows us that the contradictions between the cor-rect thinking of Lenin and Stalin and the falla-cious thinking of Trotsky, Bukharin and others did not at first manifest themselves in an antago-nistic form, but that later they did develop into antagonism. There are similar cases in the history of the Chinese Communist Party. At first the contradictions between the correct thinking of many of our Party comrades and the fallacious thinking of Chen Tu-hsiu, Chang Kuo-tao and others also did not manifest themselves in an an-tagonistic form, but later they did develop into antagonism. At present the contradiction be-tween correct and incorrect thinking in our Party does not manifest itself in an antagonistic form, and if comrades who have committed mistakes can correct them, it will not develop into antago-nism. Therefore, the Party must on the one hand wage a serious struggle against erroneous thinking, and on the other give the comrades who have committed errors ample opportunity to wake up. This being the case, excessive struggle is obvi-ously inappropriate. But if the people who have committed errors persist in them and aggravate them, there is the possibility that this contradic-tion will develop into antagonism.

Economically, the contradiction between town and country is an extremely antagonistic one both in capitalist society, where under the rule of the bourgeoisie the towns ruthlessly plun-der the countryside, and in the Kuomintang ar-eas in China, where under the rule of foreign imperialism and the Chinese big comprador bour-geoisie the towns most rapaciously plunder the countryside. But in a socialist country and in our revolutionary base areas, this antagonistic con-tradiction has changed into one that is non-an-tagonistic; and when communist society is reached it will be abolished.

Lenin said, “Antagonism and contradiction are not at all one and the same. Under socialism, the first will disappear, the second will remain.”1 That is to say, antagonism is one form, but not the only form, of the struggle of opposites; the formula of antagonism cannot be arbitrarily ap-plied everywhere.


We may now say a few words to sum up. The law of contradiction in things, that is, the law of the unity of opposites, is the fundamental law of nature and of society and therefore also the fun-damental law of thought. It stands opposed to the metaphysical world outlook. It represents a great revolution in the history of human knowledge. According to dialectical materialism, contradiction is present in all processes of objec-tively existing things and of subjective thought and permeates all these processes from beginning to end; this is the universality and absoluteness of contradiction. Each contradiction and each of its aspects have their respective characteristics; this is the particularity and relativity of contradiction.

In given conditions, opposites possess iden-tity, and consequently can coexist in a single en-tity and can transform themselves into each other; this again is the particularity and relativity of contradiction. But the struggle of opposites is ceaseless, it goes on both when the opposites are coexisting and when they are transforming them-selves into each other, and becomes especially conspicuous when they are transforming themselves into one another; this again is the univer-sality and absoluteness of contradiction. In stud-ying the particularity and relativity of contradic-tion, we must give attention to the distinction be-tween the principal contradiction and the non-principal contradictions and to the distinction between the principal aspect and the non-princi-pal aspect of a contradiction; in studying the uni-versality of contradiction and the struggle of op-posites in contradiction, we must give attention to the distinction between the different forms of struggle. Otherwise we shall make mistakes. If, through study, we achieve a real understanding of the essentials explained above, we shall be able to demolish dogmatist ideas which are contrary to the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and detrimental to our revolutionary cause, and our comrades with practical experience will be able to organize their experience into principles and avoid repeating empiricist errors. These are a few simple conclusions from our study of the law of contradiction.

Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the skies? No. Are they innate in the mind? No. They come from social practice, and from it alone; they come from three kinds of so-cial practice, the struggle for production, the class struggle and scientific experiment. It is man’s social being that determines his thinking. Once the correct ideas characteristic of the advanced class are grasped by the masses, these ideas turn into a material force which changes so-ciety and changes the world. In their social prac-tice, men engage in various kinds of struggle and gain rich experience, both from their successes and from their failures. Countless phenomena of the objective external world are reflected in a man’s brain through his five sense organs — the organs of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. At first, knowledge is perceptual. The leap to conceptual knowledge, i.e., to ideas, occurs when sufficient perceptual knowledge is accumulated. This is one process in cognition. It is the first stage in the whole process of cognition; the stage leading from objective matter to subjective con-sciousness, from existence to ideas. Whether or not one’s consciousness or ideas (including theo-ries, policies, plans or measures) do correctly re-flect the laws of the objective external world is not yet proved at this stage, in which it is not yet possible to ascertain whether they are correct or not. Then comes the second stage in the process of cognition, the stage leading from conscious-ness back to matter, from ideas back to existence, in which the knowledge gained in the first stage is applied in social practice to ascertain whether the theories, policies, plans or measures meet with the anticipated success.

Generally speaking, those that succeed are correct and those that fail are incorrect, and this is especially true of man’s struggle with nature. In social struggle, the forces representing the advanced class sometimes suffer defeat not because their ideas are incorrect but because, in the balance of forces engaged in struggle, they are not as powerful for the time being as the forces of reaction; they are therefore temporarily defeated, but they are bound to tri-umph sooner or later. Man’s knowledge makes another leap through the test of practice. This leap is more important than the previous one. For it is this leap alone that can prove the cor-rectness or incorrectness of the first leap in cog-nition, i.e., of the ideas, theories, policies, plans or measures formulated in the course of reflecting the objective external world. There is no other way of testing truth. Furthermore, the one and only purpose of the proletariat in knowing the world is to change it.

Often, correct knowledge can be arrived at only after many repetitions of the process leading from matter to consciousness and then back to matter, that is, leading from practice to knowledge and then back to practice. Such is the Marxist theory of knowledge, the di-alectical materialist theory of knowledge. Among our comrades there are many who do not yet un-derstand this theory of knowledge. When asked the sources of their ideas, opinions, policies, methods, plans and conclusions, eloquent speeches and long articles, they consider the questions strange and cannot answer it. Nor do they comprehend that matter, can be trans-formed into consciousness and consciousness into matter, although such leaps are phenomena of everyday life. It is therefore necessary to edu-cate our comrades in the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge, so that they can orientate their thinking correctly, become good at investigation and study and at summing up experience, overcome difficulties, commit fewer mistakes, do their work better, and struggle hard so as to build China into a great and powerful socialist country and help the broad masses of the oppressed and exploited throughout the world in fulfillment of our great internationalist duty.
