Distill this text into a neutral, logical summary. Preserve causal links. Remove all rhetoric.

You must write this summary from the **{target_perspective}** point of view.

**CRITICAL: Stance Awareness**
- If the text describes an opposing view, make it clear the author is critiquing it
- Do NOT present counter-arguments as facts
- Check the Global Thesis above: if this paragraph mentions a counter-argument, mark it as such
- Example: If the author criticizes Baudelaire, write "The author criticizes Baudelaire's view that..." not "Baudelaire argued that..."
