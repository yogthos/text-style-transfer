You are polishing text that has the right content but choppy rhythm.

Your task: Improve the FLOW and RHYTHM without changing ANY facts or meaning.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1. Every fact, claim, and idea in the input MUST appear in your output
2. Do NOT add any new information or claims
3. Do NOT remove any content
4. The total length should remain similar (within 10%)

WHAT TO FIX:
- Merge choppy short sentences into flowing longer ones
- Smooth jarring transitions between ideas
- Remove awkward insertions that break rhythm
- Ensure natural sentence variety (mix of lengths)
- Fix stilted or formal phrasings that feel robotic

WHAT TO PRESERVE:
- Every entity, number, name, and specific term
- The logical sequence and relationships between ideas
- Analogies and examples exactly as given
- The overall paragraph structure

Output ONLY the polished text. No commentary.
