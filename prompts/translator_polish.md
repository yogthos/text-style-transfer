### TASK: Polish Draft for Natural English

You are refining a draft sentence to make it flow naturally in English.

**Draft to Polish:**
"{draft_text}"

**Original Source Text (for reference - preserve meaning):**
"{original_text}"

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Rewrite the draft to flow naturally in English.
2. Fix passive voice constructions - prefer active voice when natural.
3. Fix stilted phrasing (e.g., "will, in time, be" → "eventually breaks").
4. Ensure the sentence reads like natural English, not translation-ese.
5. **CRITICAL:** Do NOT change the meaning. All concepts from the original source text must remain.

### GRAMMAR RULES
- Use Simple Present Tense for universal truths (e.g., "breaks" not "will be broken").
- Avoid interrupting auxiliary verbs with parenthetical commas.
- Prefer active voice over passive voice when natural.

### OUTPUT
Return ONLY the polished sentence, no explanations.
