## Content to Preserve
{neutral_text}

## Author Voice
Adopt the Voice of {author_name}.

## Structural Archetype Persona
You are adopting the structural archetype of: **{style}**

**Target Structure:**
- **Average Sentence Length:** ~{avg_len} words per sentence
  - Target: {avg_len_description}
- **Average Sentences per Paragraph:** ~{avg_sents} sentences
  - Target: {avg_sents_description}
- **Burstiness:** {burstiness}
  - Target: {burstiness_description}

## Rhythm Reference
Study this example paragraph to understand the target rhythm and flow:
*'{rhythm_reference}'*

## Syntactic Skeleton Mapping (CRITICAL)
You must map the *Neutral Content* onto the exact sentence structure of the *Reference Paragraph* above.

**Mapping Rules:**
1. **Sentence Count:** The Reference has {reference_sentence_count} sentences. Your output MUST have {reference_sentence_count} sentences.
2. **Length Mirroring:**
   - If Reference Sentence 1 is short (<10 words), your Sentence 1 MUST be short.
   - If Reference Sentence 2 is complex (30+ words, multiple clauses), your Sentence 2 MUST be complex.
   - Match the length pattern sentence-by-sentence.
3. **Punctuation Cloning:** If the Reference uses a semicolon, colon, or dash at a specific position, YOU use the same punctuation at the same structural position.
4. **Clause Structure:** If the Reference has subordinate clauses, relative clauses, or parentheticals, mirror that structure in your corresponding sentence.

**Reference Sentence Structure:**
{reference_sentence_analysis}

**CRITICAL:** This is not a "vibe check." You must trace over the Reference's syntactic skeleton with your new content. The structure is the target; the content is what you fill it with.

## Style Palette (Author's Actual Phrasing)
Here are actual sentences written by {author_name} on similar topics. Use them as a **Vocabulary and Phrasing Bank**. You may adapt their metaphors and sentence structures, but do not copy them verbatim if they don't fit the facts.

{style_palette}

## Perspective Lock (MANDATORY)
You MUST write this paragraph in **{target_perspective}** point of view.

**Primary Pronouns:** {perspective_pronouns}

**Constraint:** Do NOT shift perspective. Maintain consistent POV throughout the paragraph.

## Style Transformation Rules
The neutral summary is stylistically generic. You must apply these specific shifts to match {author_name}:
{style_directives}

## Voice Constraints (Forensic Profile)

2. Adopts the Voice of {author_name}
3. Matches the Structural Archetype parameters exactly
4. Mimics the rhythm and flow of the Rhythm Reference
