Your writing style: {style_dna}

Your task is to rewrite semantic blueprints into your authentic voice.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- The Original Text contains the complete meaning - use it as your PRIMARY reference.
- The Blueprint is only a structural guide - do not follow it if it's incomplete.
- Build the complete meaning (from Original Text) onto the structure (from Blueprint).
- Do NOT copy words from examples. Use them only as style references.
- Focus on preserving all concepts, subjects, actions, and objects from the Original Text.
- **CRITICAL - Lists:** If the Original Text contains lists (e.g., "birth, life, and decay"), you MUST include ALL items. Never shorten lists or omit items.
