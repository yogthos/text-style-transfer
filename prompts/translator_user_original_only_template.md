TASK: Rewrite the following content into your voice.
RHETORICAL MODE: {rhetorical_type}

{context_block}=== STYLE EXAMPLES (Use ONLY for tone/style reference, DO NOT copy words) ===
HERE IS HOW YOU WRITE {rhetorical_type}s:
{examples_text}

=== SOURCE TEXT (PRIMARY REFERENCE - PRESERVE ALL MEANING) ===
**ORIGINAL TEXT:** "{original_text}"

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- This is the COMPLETE original text with all meaning, details, adjectives, and context.
- You MUST preserve ALL concepts, subjects, objects, and nuances from this source text.
- **CRITICAL - LIST PRESERVATION:** If the source text contains lists (e.g., "birth, life, and decay"), you MUST include ALL items in the list. Do NOT shorten "birth, life, and decay" to just "birth". Every item in every list must appear in your output.
- **CRITICAL - NO OMISSIONS:** Do NOT omit nouns or core meaning found in this text. If the source says "Every object we touch breaks", you MUST include "object" - do not shorten to "We touch breaks".
- **CRITICAL - COMPLETE SENTENCES:** Ensure your output is a FULL, FLUENT English sentence with Subject, Verb, and Object.
- **CRITICAL - STYLE TRANSFORMATION:** DO NOT copy the original text verbatim. You MUST transform it into the target style shown in the examples. If you output the exact same text as the input, your response will be REJECTED. Preserving meaning does NOT mean copying words - it means expressing the same concepts in the target style.

=== CONSTRAINTS (HARD REQUIREMENTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE) ===
- **CRITICAL - Logical Harmony (HARD REQUIREMENT):**
  * Do NOT use modifiers that contradict the noun's definition.
  * BAD Examples: "Ceaseless finitude" (ceaseless = unending, finitude = having limits), "Infinite boundary" (infinite = unlimited, boundary = limit), "Eternal decay" (eternal = permanent, decay = deterioration).
  * GOOD Examples: "Strict finitude", "Inescapable finitude", "Definite boundary".
  * If you create a contradiction, the output will be REJECTED. Check modifier-noun compatibility before writing.

- **CRITICAL - Complete List Preservation:** If the source text says "birth, life, and decay", your output MUST say "birth, life, and decay" (or equivalent phrasing with all three items). Do NOT output "birth" alone or "birth and decay" - ALL items must be present.

=== GRAMMAR RULES (CRITICAL) ===
- **RHETORICAL TENSE RULE:** When writing **Observations** or **Universal Truths** (e.g., physics, cycles of life, natural laws), use the **SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE**.
  * BAD: Every star will, in time, die. (Future Passive/Stilted)
  * GOOD: Every star eventually dies. (Simple Present/Active)
  * BAD: Objects will be broken.
  * GOOD: Objects break.
  * BAD: The star will be eroded.
  * GOOD: The star succumbs to erosion.
  * BAD: It will, in time, break.
  * GOOD: It eventually breaks.
- **DO NOT** interrupt auxiliary verbs (will/shall) with parenthetical commas. Use adverbs before the verb instead (e.g., "eventually breaks" not "will, in time, break").

- DO NOT copy words from the examples - they are only style references.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Read the SOURCE TEXT above - this contains the complete meaning you must preserve.
2. Use the STYLE EXAMPLES to understand the tone and voice - they show HOW to write, not WHAT to write.
3. **TRANSFORM** the SOURCE TEXT into the target style shown in the examples. Do NOT copy it verbatim.
4. Express the complete meaning in the style shown in the examples, using different words and phrasing.
5. Ensure your output is a complete, fluent sentence.
6. **REMEMBER:** If your output is identical to the input, it will be REJECTED. You must change the wording while preserving meaning.
