TASK: Rewrite the following content into your voice.
RHETORICAL MODE: {rhetorical_type}

{context_block}=== STYLE EXAMPLES (Use ONLY for tone/style reference, DO NOT copy words) ===
HERE IS HOW YOU WRITE {rhetorical_type}s:
{examples_text}

=== CONTEXT (PRIMARY SOURCE - READ THIS FIRST) ===
**SOURCE TEXT:** "{original_text}"

This is the COMPLETE original text with all meaning, details, adjectives, and context.
- You MUST extract ALL concepts, subjects, objects, and nuances from this source text.
- **CRITICAL - LIST PRESERVATION:** If the source text contains lists (e.g., "birth, life, and decay"), you MUST include ALL items in the list. Do NOT shorten "birth, life, and decay" to just "birth". Every item in every list must appear in your output.
- **CRITICAL - NO OMISSIONS:** Do NOT omit nouns or core meaning found in this Context. If the source says "Every object we touch breaks", you MUST include "object" - do not shorten to "We touch breaks".

=== STRUCTURE CHECKLIST (Use as Guide, Not Source) ===
The following elements should appear in your output, but the SOURCE TEXT above is your primary reference:
- Subjects: {subjects}
- Actions: {verbs}
- Objects: {objects}
- Entities: {entities}
- Keywords: {keywords}

**Instruction:** Rewrite the [SOURCE TEXT] above to match the structure suggested by this checklist. Do not omit nouns or core meaning found in the Context.

=== CONSTRAINTS (HARD REQUIREMENTS - NON-NEGOTIABLE) ===
- **CRITICAL - Logical Harmony (HARD REQUIREMENT):**
  * Do NOT use modifiers that contradict the noun's definition.
  * BAD Examples: "Ceaseless finitude" (ceaseless = unending, finitude = having limits), "Infinite boundary" (infinite = unlimited, boundary = limit), "Eternal decay" (eternal = permanent, decay = deterioration).
  * GOOD Examples: "Strict finitude", "Inescapable finitude", "Definite boundary".
  * If you create a contradiction, the output will be REJECTED. Check modifier-noun compatibility before writing.

- **Anti-Starvation:** If the Blueprint is "We touch breaks" but The Meat says "Every object we touch breaks", you MUST restore the word "object" from The Meat.

- **CRITICAL - Complete List Preservation:** If The Meat says "birth, life, and decay", your output MUST say "birth, life, and decay" (or equivalent phrasing with all three items). Do NOT output "birth" alone or "birth and decay" - ALL items must be present.

- **Task:** Build the Meat onto the Skeleton. Do not leave the Skeleton bare.

=== GRAMMAR RULES (CRITICAL) ===
- **RHETORICAL TENSE RULE:** When writing **Observations** or **Universal Truths** (e.g., physics, cycles of life, natural laws), use the **SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE**.
  * BAD: Every star will, in time, die. (Future Passive/Stilted)
  * GOOD: Every star eventually dies. (Simple Present/Active)
  * BAD: Objects will be broken.
  * GOOD: Objects break.
  * BAD: The star will be eroded.
  * GOOD: The star succumbs to erosion.
  * BAD: It will, in time, break.
  * GOOD: It eventually breaks.
- **DO NOT** interrupt auxiliary verbs (will/shall) with parenthetical commas. Use adverbs before the verb instead (e.g., "eventually breaks" not "will, in time, break").

- DO NOT copy words from the examples - they are only style references.
- DO NOT blindly follow a broken Blueprint if it results in nonsense - use The Meat to complete it.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Read the SOURCE TEXT (Context) above - this contains the complete meaning you must preserve.
2. Use the STYLE EXAMPLES to understand the tone and voice.
3. Use the STRUCTURE CHECKLIST as a guide for organizing the content, but do NOT omit anything from the SOURCE TEXT.
4. Rewrite the SOURCE TEXT to match the structure suggested by the checklist, while preserving ALL meaning from the Context.
5. Express the complete meaning in the style shown in the examples.
